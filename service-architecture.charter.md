# **Charter: The Service Architecture**

This Charter defines the foundational architecture for all services within the Company OS. It establishes how we structure capabilities as evolving services, enabling the system to scale from simple files to sophisticated platforms while maintaining consistency and autonomy.

---

## **1. Vision: The Living Service Ecosystem**

To create a self-evolving ecosystem of domain services where every capability—from managing charters to orchestrating projects—is treated as an autonomous service from inception. These services start simple (as organized markdown files) and evolve independently based on proven need, always maintaining stable interfaces while their implementations grow more sophisticated.

This architecture enables the OS to use its own services to build itself, creating a recursive improvement cycle where better tools lead to better tools.

---

## **2. The "Why" (Core Rationale)**

Traditional systems suffer from premature optimization or delayed abstraction. This architecture solves for:

1. **Evolution Without Revolution**: Services can evolve from files to APIs to SaaS without breaking changes.
2. **Self-Referential Growth**: The OS uses its own services to improve itself, creating compounding returns.
3. **Independent Scaling**: Each domain evolves at its own pace based on actual usage patterns.
4. **Cognitive Clarity**: Clear service boundaries prevent concerns from bleeding across domains.

---

## **3. First Principles (The Mental Model)**

*All services within the Company OS MUST adhere to these principles.*

1. **Everything is a Service Domain**: Every capability, no matter how simple, is structured as a bounded context with data, API, and adapters.
2. **Hexagonal by Design**: Services expose ports (interfaces) and use adapters (implementations), enabling implementation changes without interface changes.
3. **Start Simple, Evolve on Demand**: Begin with file-based implementations. Add complexity only when measured friction justifies it.
4. **Stable APIs, Evolving Implementations**: Service interfaces are contracts that remain stable. Implementations evolve freely behind these contracts.
5. **Self-Referential Architecture**: The OS must use its own service patterns to manage and evolve itself.

---

## **4. The Service Evolution Stages**

Every service follows a predictable evolution path:

### Stage 0: File-Based Foundation
- Data stored as structured markdown files
- Direct file manipulation by humans/AI
- Schema validation via conventions

### Stage 1: Local API Layer
- Programmatic API wrapping file operations
- MCP server for AI agent access
- CLI tools for human access

### Stage 2: Optimization & Caching
- Local database for performance
- Bi-directional sync with files
- Advanced querying capabilities

### Stage 3: External Adapters
- Multiple storage backends
- Third-party service integration
- Adapter pattern for flexibility

### Stage 4: Platform Migration
- Full migration to dedicated platform
- Original API maintained as proxy
- Seamless transition for consumers

## **5. Service Anatomy**

Every service domain MUST contain:

```
/{domain-name}/
  /data/        # Current storage (starts as .md files)
  /api/         # Service interface definitions
  /adapters/    # Implementation adapters
  /schemas/     # Domain-specific schemas
  /docs/        # Service documentation
```

---

## **6. Inter-Service Communication**

Services communicate through:
1. **Events**: Asynchronous notifications via the signal system
2. **APIs**: Synchronous calls through defined interfaces
3. **Shared Schemas**: Common data contracts in `/schemas`

---

## **7. Process for Evolution**

Service evolution follows the Synapse Methodology. Changes to this Charter require analysis of impact on all child architectures, particularly the Repository and Knowledge architectures.
