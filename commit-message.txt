feat(rules-service): register service in the registry

Adds the Rules Service to the official service registry at `/os/domains/registry/data/services.registry.md`.

The service is registered at Stage 0 (file-based) and its capabilities are documented as rule discovery, synchronization, and validation.

This completes Task 1.2 of Milestone 1.
