feat(rules-service): create bazel workspace configuration

Creates the initial Bazel workspace configuration, including:
- An empty `WORKSPACE` file.
- `BUILD.bazel` files for the `company_os_core` library, the `rules_service` source, and the `cli` and `pre_commit` adapters.

This completes Task 1.4 of Milestone 1.
