# Infrastructure: Deployment & Operations

This directory contains infrastructure-related files for deployment, operations, and system maintenance. It supports the operational needs of the Company OS without being a service domain itself.

## Governing Documents
- **Parent Charter**: [Repository Architecture](../os/domains/charters/data/repository-architecture.charter.md)
- **Related Rules**: [Repository System Rules](../os/domains/rules/data/repository-system.rules.md)

## Structure

### [docs/](docs/) - Infrastructure Documentation
- **Purpose**: Documentation for infrastructure, migrations, and system operations
- **Key Documents**:
  - [Migration Guide](docs/migration-guide.md) - Service-oriented architecture migration

### [environments/](environments/) - Environment Configurations
- **Purpose**: Environment-specific configurations for different deployment contexts
- **Current State**: Empty, ready for environment configs
- **Examples**: `dev.env`, `staging.env`, `production.env`

### [scripts/](scripts/) - Operational Scripts
- **Purpose**: Automation scripts for deployment, maintenance, and operations
- **Current State**: Empty, ready for operational scripts
- **Examples**: Deployment scripts, backup scripts, health checks

## Usage Patterns

### For System Operations
1. **Documentation**: Check [docs/](docs/) for operational guidance
2. **Environment Setup**: Use [environments/](environments/) for configuration
3. **Automation**: Leverage [scripts/](scripts/) for operational tasks

### For Service Evolution
As services evolve to higher stages, they may require:
- Deployment configurations in `environments/`
- Operational scripts in `scripts/`
- Infrastructure documentation in `docs/`

## Relationship to Service Domains

Infrastructure supports all service domains but is not itself a service. It provides:
- **Cross-cutting Support**: Environment configs used by multiple services
- **Operational Context**: Scripts and docs for service deployment and maintenance
- **Evolution Support**: Infrastructure patterns for services advancing beyond Stage 0

This maintains the separation between service logic (in service domains) and operational concerns (in infrastructure).
