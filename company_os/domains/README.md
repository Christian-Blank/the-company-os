# **Company OS Service Domains**

This directory organizes all Company OS services into logical domains following the Service Architecture Charter. Each domain represents a bounded context with clear responsibilities and interfaces.

## **Quick Navigation**

### **By Purpose**

**📋 Governance & Standards**
- [Charters](charters/) - Vision and constitutional documents
- [Rules](rules/) - Operational rules and constraints
- [Principles](principles/) - Deep explanations of first principles
- [Paradigms](paradigms/) - Foundational mental models

**🧠 Knowledge & Memory**
- [Knowledge](knowledge/) - System memory and knowledge graph
- [Registry](registry/) - Service discovery and status

**⚙️ Execution & Process**
- [Workflows](workflows/) - Step-by-step executable procedures
- [Processes](processes/) - Strategic methodologies
- [Evolution](evolution/) - System improvement mechanisms

**🔧 Services & Tools**
- [Rules Service](rules_service/) ✅ - Automated rule management
- [Maintenance Service](maintenance_service/) - System maintenance
- [Configuration](configuration/) - Agent and system config

### **By Evolution Stage**

| Stage | Services | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Stage 0** | All current services | File-based, manual processes |
| **Stage 0 Complete** | Rules Service | Full automation achieved |
| **Stage 1+** | None yet | API-based services (future) |

## **Domain Structure Pattern**

Each domain follows this standard structure:
```
domain_name/
├── README.md           # Domain navigation and overview
├── data/              # Stage 0: File-based storage
│   └── *.md           # Domain-specific documents
├── docs/              # Domain documentation
│   ├── README.md      # Documentation overview
│   ├── api.md         # API documentation (when applicable)
│   └── patterns.md    # Domain-specific patterns
├── src/               # Implementation code (for services)
├── tests/             # Domain tests
└── BUILD.bazel        # Build configuration
```

## **Understanding Service Boundaries**

### **Core Principle: Clear Boundaries**
Each domain has exclusive ownership of its concerns:
- **Single Responsibility**: One domain, one purpose
- **Clear Interfaces**: Well-defined interaction points
- **No Overlaps**: Distinct boundaries prevent conflicts
- **Evolution Ready**: Can evolve independently

### **Cross-Domain Communication**
- Use explicit interfaces (files now, APIs later)
- Reference via registry for discovery
- Follow established integration patterns
- Maintain loose coupling

## **Working with Domains**

### **For Domain Owners**
1. **Maintain Clear Boundaries**: Don't expand beyond your scope
2. **Document Interfaces**: Make integration points explicit
3. **Evolve Responsibly**: Consider downstream impacts
4. **Update Registry**: Keep service status current

### **For Domain Users**
1. **Start with README**: Each domain has navigation
2. **Check Registry**: Verify service status and interfaces
3. **Follow Patterns**: Use established domain patterns
4. **Respect Boundaries**: Don't bypass domain interfaces

### **For New Domains**
1. **Define Charter**: Create governing charter first
2. **Establish Boundaries**: Clear scope and responsibilities
3. **Create Structure**: Follow standard pattern
4. **Register Service**: Add to services registry
5. **Document Interfaces**: Define integration points

## **Domain Categories**

### **🏛️ Governance Domains**
Domains that define how the system operates:
- **Charters**: Constitutional governance
- **Rules**: Operational constraints
- **Principles**: Core beliefs
- **Paradigms**: Mental models

### **📚 Knowledge Domains**
Domains that manage system information:
- **Knowledge**: System memory
- **Registry**: Service catalog

### **🔄 Process Domains**
Domains that define how work gets done:
- **Workflows**: Executable procedures
- **Processes**: Methodologies
- **Evolution**: Improvement systems

### **🛠️ Service Domains**
Domains that provide active functionality:
- **Rules Service**: Rule automation
- **Maintenance Service**: System upkeep
- **Configuration**: Settings management

## **Evolution Patterns**

### **Stage Progression**
Domains evolve based on measured friction:
1. **Stage 0**: Start with files and manual processes
2. **Measure Friction**: Track pain points and inefficiencies
3. **Build Incrementally**: Add automation where needed
4. **Evolve to APIs**: When integration demands it
5. **Full Service**: When complexity requires it

### **Success Story: Rules Service**
- Started as manual rule files
- Identified synchronization friction
- Built CLI and automation
- Achieved Stage 0 completion
- Model for other services

## **Best Practices**

### **Domain Design**
- **Start Simple**: File-based is fine initially
- **Measure Everything**: Data drives evolution
- **Document Clearly**: Navigation is crucial
- **Test Boundaries**: Ensure clean separation
- **Plan Evolution**: Consider future stages

### **Documentation Standards**
- Every domain needs a README
- Document both current and future state
- Include examples and patterns
- Keep navigation up to date
- Link to governing charters

### **Integration Guidelines**
- Use registry for discovery
- Define clear interfaces
- Version your contracts
- Plan for backward compatibility
- Document breaking changes

## **Getting Started**

### **Exploring a Domain**
1. Read the domain's README
2. Check its governing charter
3. Review current status in registry
4. Explore data/ for examples
5. Check docs/ for details

### **Contributing to a Domain**
1. Understand its boundaries
2. Follow domain patterns
3. Update documentation
4. Test your changes
5. Update registry if needed

### **Creating a New Domain**
1. Identify clear need and scope
2. Draft governing charter
3. Define service boundaries
4. Create standard structure
5. Register in service registry
