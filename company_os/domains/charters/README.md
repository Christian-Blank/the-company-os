# Charters Service Domain

The charters service manages all charter documents that define the vision, principles, and governance structure of the Company OS. Charters are the foundational documents from which all other system components derive their authority and direction.

## Service Information
- **Evolution Stage**: 0 (File-based)
- **Service Registry**: [OS Services](../registry/data/services.registry.md)
- **Governing Charter**: [Service Architecture](data/service-architecture.charter.md)

## Structure

### [data/](data/) - Charter Documents
All charter documents defining system vision and governance:

#### Root Charter
- **[Company OS Charter](data/company-os.charter.md)** - The foundational charter defining the entire system's vision and principles

#### Architecture Charters
- **[Service Architecture](data/service-architecture.charter.md)** - Defines the service-oriented architecture principles
- **[Repository Architecture](data/repository-architecture.charter.md)** - Defines file organization and repository structure  
- **[Knowledge Architecture](data/knowledge-architecture.charter.md)** - Defines knowledge graph and documentation principles

#### Domain Charters

The charters in this domain govern these system components:
- **Rules**: [Service](../rules/data/service-system.rules.md), [Repository](../rules/data/repository-system.rules.md), [Knowledge](../rules/data/knowledge-system.rules.md) systems
- **Processes**: [Synapse Methodology](../processes/data/synapse.methodology.md)
- **Services**: All service domains and their evolution

## Working with Charters

### Reading Charters
1. **Start with Root**: Begin with [Company OS Charter](data/company-os.charter.md)
2. **Follow Hierarchy**: Use `parent_charter` links to navigate relationships
3. **Check Dependencies**: See which rules and processes derive from each charter

### Modifying Charters
1. **Impact Analysis**: Consider all derived documents and services
2. **Evolution Process**: Follow [Synapse Methodology](../processes/data/synapse.methodology.md)
3. **Version Management**: Update version and last_updated fields
4. **Cascade Updates**: Update any derived rules or processes as needed

## Service Evolution

Future evolution of this service might include:
- **Stage 1**: Charter validation API, change tracking
- **Stage 2**: Charter database with relationship mapping
- **Stage 3**: Integration with external governance systems
- **Stage 4**: Full governance platform with workflow automation
