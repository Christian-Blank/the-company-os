## 1 Purpose
Guarantee continuous conformance between declared governance artefacts (charters, rules, schemas, templates) and the repository's real state through automated validation, generation, and monitoring.

## 2 Scope
* **Validation** – schema linting, front‑matter checks, graph integrity.
* **Generation** – template scaffolding, metadata auto‑fill.
* **Monitoring** – scheduled health checks, drift reports.
* **Repair** – auto‑fix safe issues, raise Signals for unsafe ones.

## 3 First Principles
1. **Fail Fast, Fix Fast** – detect and act before merge.
2. **Deterministic Repair** – every auto‑fix is reproducible from event log.
3. **Human‑in‑Loop by Default** – unsafe repairs open PRs, never silent.
4. **Extensible Checks** – rule plugins discoverable via entry‑points.

## 4 Evolution Stages
Stage 0 (v0): file‑based CLI + pre‑commit
Stage 1: Temporal‑backed CI workflow
Stage 2: Indexed health DB & dashboard
Stage 3: Cross‑repo fleet conformance
Stage 4: Autonomous self‑tuning maintenance agents
