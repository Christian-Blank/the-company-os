# **Charter: The Knowledge Architecture**

This document defines the vision and principles for organizing all records, documents, and knowledge within the Company OS. It serves as the blueprint for our "Documentation as Code" approach.

---

## **1. Vision (The North Star ⭐)**

To create a practical, scalable documentation system that serves as the canonical memory for the entire Company OS. This system makes all context discoverable, traceable, and actionable for both human and AI collaborators through clear, maintainable documentation patterns.

---

## **2. First Principles**

*This architecture is governed by the principles of its parent, `company-os.charter.md`, and is further guided by the following:*

1.  **Documentation as Code**: All knowledge is stored as version-controlled markdown files alongside the code it describes. Documentation evolves with the system it documents.
2.  **Service-Centric Organization**: Each service domain owns its documentation within its boundaries. Global documentation provides navigation and integration patterns.
3.  **Audience-Specific Entry Points**: Different entry points serve different needs - user guides, developer documentation, and LLM context - all maintained from the same sources.
4.  **Practical Metadata**: Use minimal, essential metadata for organization and discovery. Avoid over-engineering metadata systems.
5.  **Evolution Through Usage**: Document what exists and is actively used. Deprecate unused documentation immediately rather than maintaining stale information.

---

## **3. The Mental Model: Documentation Layers**

We organize documentation in three complementary layers:

### **Layer 1: Service Documentation**
* Each service owns its domain-specific documentation
* Located within the service's directory structure
* Includes APIs, implementation details, and service-specific guides
* Maintained by service owners as part of development

### **Layer 2: Global Navigation**
* Cross-service documentation and navigation
* System-wide patterns and principles
* Architecture overviews and service interactions
* Located in `/docs/` at repository root

### **Layer 3: Context Integration**
* LLM-optimized documentation for AI collaboration
* Consolidated context for development sessions
* Maintained as views over Layer 1 and Layer 2 content
* Automatically generated where possible

---

## **4. Documentation Structure**

### **Global Documentation Hub (`/docs/`)**
```
/docs/
├── README.md                   # Master navigation and quick start
├── architecture/               # System architecture documentation
│   ├── overview.md
│   ├── service-boundaries.md
│   └── patterns/
├── users/                      # User-facing documentation
│   ├── getting-started.md
│   ├── cli-reference.md
│   └── workflows/
├── developers/                 # Developer documentation
│   ├── contributing.md
│   ├── service-creation.md
│   ├── testing-patterns.md
│   └── build-system.md
└── llm/                        # LLM-specific context
    ├── context-complete.md     # Full system context
    └── service-contexts/       # Per-service contexts
```

### **Service Documentation Pattern**
```
/service_domain/
├── docs/
│   ├── README.md              # Service overview and quick start
│   ├── api.md                 # API documentation
│   ├── implementation.md      # Implementation details
│   └── patterns.md            # Service-specific patterns
├── examples/                  # Working examples
└── tests/                     # Tests as documentation
```

---

## **5. Documentation Standards**

### **File Naming Convention**
* `name.type.md` for formal documents (charters, decisions, etc.)
* `README.md` for entry points and overviews
* `descriptive-name.md` for guides and documentation
* Consistent naming within each service domain

### **Required Frontmatter**
```yaml
---
title: "Human-readable title"
type: "document_type"  # guide, reference, api, overview, etc.
service: "service_name"  # if service-specific
audience: ["users", "developers", "llm"]  # target audience
last_updated: "2025-07-16T15:33:00-07:00"
tags: ["relevant", "tags"]
---
```

### **Content Structure**
1. **Purpose Statement**: Clear statement of what this document covers
2. **Quick Start**: Immediate actionable information
3. **Details**: Comprehensive information organized logically
4. **Examples**: Working examples where applicable
5. **References**: Links to related documentation

---

## **6. Maintenance Strategy**

### **Service Ownership**
* Each service team owns their documentation
* Documentation updates are part of feature development
* Service documentation is reviewed with code changes

### **Global Coordination**
* Global documentation maintained by OS Core Team
* Regular review of cross-service documentation
* Deprecated documentation is removed, not archived

### **LLM Context Management**
* LLM contexts are generated from canonical documentation
* Automated tooling maintains context consistency
* Manual curation for critical LLM context elements

---

## **7. Evolution Path**

### **Phase 1: Foundation (Current)**
* Establish documentation structure and patterns
* Migrate existing documentation to new patterns
* Create tooling for documentation maintenance

### **Phase 2: Automation**
* Automated documentation generation from code
* Automated LLM context generation
* Documentation quality metrics and enforcement

### **Phase 3: Intelligence**
* Semantic search across documentation
* Automated documentation updates
* AI-assisted documentation authoring

---

## **8. Success Metrics**

* **Discoverability**: Time to find relevant information
* **Accuracy**: Documentation matches implementation
* **Completeness**: Coverage of user and developer needs
* **Maintainability**: Effort required to keep documentation current
* **Usability**: User success in accomplishing tasks with documentation

---

## **9. Implementation Guidelines**

### **For Service Teams**
1. Create service documentation following the standard pattern
2. Include working examples and API documentation
3. Update documentation as part of development workflow
4. Review documentation in code review process

### **For Global Documentation**
1. Focus on navigation and integration patterns
2. Avoid duplicating service-specific information
3. Maintain clear entry points for different audiences
4. Regularly review and update global documentation

### **For LLM Context**
1. Generate context from canonical documentation sources
2. Include essential system context and patterns
3. Maintain context consistency across sessions
4. Optimize for development workflow efficiency

## **10. Process for Evolution**

This Charter is a living document. Changes must be proposed via pull request and adhere to the evolution process defined in the parent `company-os.charter.md`. All changes should be tested with actual usage before implementation.
