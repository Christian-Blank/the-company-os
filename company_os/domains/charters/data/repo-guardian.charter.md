# **Charter: Repo Guardian Service**

This Charter establishes the Repo Guardian as a foundational service within the Company OS ecosystem, pioneering the integration of AI agents and workflow orchestration to maintain repository quality and drive continuous system evolution.

---

## **1. Vision: The Intelligent Quality Partner**

To create an autonomous, AI-powered guardian that acts as a living partner for repository quality management. The Repo Guardian continuously monitors, analyzes, and improves the Company OS codebase through intelligent workflow orchestration, ensuring that growth doesn't compromise quality and that every change contributes to system evolution.

This service embodies the Company OS principle of symbiotic partnership by combining human oversight with AI intelligence, creating a quality enforcement system that learns, adapts, and evolves alongside the codebase it protects.

---

## **2. The "Why" (Core Rationale)**

As the Company OS grows, maintaining quality and consistency becomes exponentially challenging. This service addresses critical needs:

1. **Scalable Quality Enforcement**: Human review doesn't scale with repository growth; intelligent automation does.
2. **Proactive Problem Detection**: Identify issues before they compound, reducing technical debt accumulation.
3. **Knowledge Capture**: Transform every analysis into explicit knowledge that improves future operations.
4. **Pattern Reinforcement**: Ensure architectural patterns and principles are consistently applied across the codebase.
5. **AI-Human Collaboration Blueprint**: Establish patterns for integrating AI agents into production workflows.

---

## **3. Service Principles**

*Aligned with Company OS First Principles, the Repo Guardian adheres to:*

1. **Continuous Analysis, Not Gatekeeping**: The service analyzes and reports, empowering teams with information rather than blocking progress.
2. **Context-Rich Feedback**: Every issue includes not just what's wrong, but why it matters and how to fix it.
3. **Evolution Through Measurement**: Success is measured by reduced complexity, improved quality metrics, and team velocity—not issue count.
4. **Cost-Conscious Intelligence**: AI analysis is optimized for value, using incremental diffs and structured outputs to control costs.
5. **Transparent Operations**: All analysis logic, decisions, and results are explicit and auditable.

---

## **4. Service Boundaries & Responsibilities**

### In Scope:
- **Repository Analysis**: Monitor code changes, structure, and patterns
- **Quality Validation**: Verify adherence to architectural principles and coding standards
- **Issue Generation**: Create actionable, context-rich GitHub issues
- **Metrics Collection**: Track quality trends and analysis effectiveness
- **Pattern Learning**: Identify recurring issues and improvement opportunities

### Out of Scope:
- **Code Modification**: The Guardian observes and reports but doesn't change code
- **Deployment Decisions**: Quality information informs but doesn't control releases
- **Human Performance Evaluation**: Focus is on code and system quality, not individual assessment

### Dependencies:
- **GitHub API**: For repository access and issue management
- **Temporal**: For workflow orchestration and reliability
- **LLM Providers**: For intelligent analysis (OpenAI, Anthropic)
- **Company OS Standards**: Rules, patterns, and architectural principles

---

## **5. Evolution Roadmap**

Following the Service Architecture evolution stages:

### Stage 0: Temporal Workflow (Current - v0)
- Temporal-orchestrated workflows analyzing repository diffs
- LLM-powered analysis with structured outputs
- GitHub issue creation for discovered problems
- Basic metrics emission

### Stage 1: API & MCP Integration (3 months)
- RESTful API for triggering analyses
- MCP server for AI agent access
- CLI tools for manual operations
- Enhanced querying and reporting

### Stage 2: Intelligence Layer (6 months)
- ML models trained on historical analyses
- Predictive quality degradation alerts
- Custom rule engine integration
- Advanced pattern detection

### Stage 3: Multi-Repository Support (9 months)
- Cross-repository pattern analysis
- Organization-wide quality dashboards
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines
- Third-party tool adapters

### Stage 4: Autonomous Platform (12+ months)
- Self-improving analysis algorithms
- Automated fix generation (with approval)
- Quality prediction and prevention
- Full platform capabilities

---

## **6. Success Metrics**

The Repo Guardian's effectiveness is measured by:

### Quality Metrics:
- **Complexity Reduction**: Cyclomatic complexity trends downward
- **Pattern Compliance**: >95% adherence to architectural patterns
- **Documentation Coverage**: 100% of new code includes appropriate docs
- **Escape Defect Rate**: <5% of issues missed by analysis

### Operational Metrics:
- **Analysis Cycle Time**: <5 minutes per repository scan
- **Cost Efficiency**: LLM costs scale sub-linearly with repo size
- **Issue Actionability**: >90% of issues require no clarification
- **System Reliability**: >99.9% workflow success rate

### Evolution Metrics:
- **Signal Generation**: >10 improvement signals per week
- **Learning Velocity**: Monthly reduction in false positives
- **Pattern Discovery**: New anti-patterns identified and documented
- **Self-Improvement**: Measurable enhancement in analysis quality

---

## **7. Governance & Evolution Process**

### Decision Rights:
- **Service Owner**: Defines vision and approves major changes
- **Technical Lead**: Makes architectural decisions within charter bounds
- **Team Members**: Implement features and propose improvements

### Change Process:
- Minor changes (bug fixes, optimizations): Team discretion
- Service evolution (new stages): Owner approval required
- Charter modifications: Follow Company OS charter evolution process

### Review Cycles:
- Weekly: Metrics review and signal triage
- Monthly: Evolution progress assessment
- Quarterly: Charter alignment verification

## **8. Integration Patterns**

The Repo Guardian integrates with the Company OS ecosystem through:

1. **Signal Generation**: Emits signals about code quality and improvement opportunities
2. **Brief Creation**: Contributes to briefs for systematic improvements
3. **Rules Consumption**: Uses rules service for validation standards
4. **Knowledge Contribution**: Adds patterns and anti-patterns to knowledge base
5. **Workflow Patterns**: Establishes blueprints for future AI-integrated workflows

---

## **9. Future Vision**

The Repo Guardian serves as more than a quality tool—it's a learning system that:
- Understands not just code syntax but architectural intent
- Predicts quality issues before they manifest
- Suggests proactive improvements based on usage patterns
- Trains other AI agents on effective code analysis
- Becomes an indispensable partner in sustainable system growth

Through continuous evolution, the Repo Guardian will transform from a reactive analyzer to a proactive quality partner, embodying the Company OS vision of symbiotic human-AI collaboration.
