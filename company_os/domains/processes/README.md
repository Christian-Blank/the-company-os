# Processes Service Domain

The processes service manages methodologies and reference documentation that provide strategic frameworks and patterns for work execution within the Company OS. This domain contains conceptual approaches and best practices, not executable procedures.

## Service Information
- **Evolution Stage**: 0 (File-based)
- **Service Registry**: [OS Services](../registry/data/services.registry.md)
- **Governing Charter**: [Service Architecture](../charters/data/service-architecture.charter.md)

## Structure

### [data/](data/) - Process Documents
Strategic frameworks and reference documentation:

#### Core Methodologies
- **[Synapse Methodology](data/synapse.methodology.md)** - The double learning loop approach to system evolution
  - *Governs*: How work execution is separated from system improvement
  - *Used by*: All service domains for continuous improvement
  - *Type*: Strategic framework for organizing work and learning

#### Reference Documentation
- **[Markdown Validation Patterns](data/markdown-validation-patterns.reference.md)** - Detailed validation patterns and schemas
  - *Governs*: Validation rule definitions, pattern matching, schema structures
  - *Used by*: Validation service, document creation workflows
  - *Type*: Reference guide for validation implementation

### [docs/](docs/) - Supporting Documentation
*Currently empty - ready for process-related documentation*

## Processes vs Workflows

### Processes (This Domain)
- **Purpose**: Strategic frameworks and reference documentation
- **Properties**: Methodologies, patterns, best practices, conceptual guidance
- **Examples**: Synapse methodology, validation patterns, architectural principles
- **Usage**: Guidance for creating workflows and making strategic decisions

### Workflows ([../workflows/](../workflows/))
- **Purpose**: Concrete, step-by-step, executable procedures
- **Properties**: Actionable, sequential, stateful, replayable
- **Examples**: Document validation steps, agent initialization checklist, standardization process
- **Usage**: Direct execution by humans or AI agents

## Working with Processes

### Using Processes
1. **Strategic Guidance**: Use methodologies to understand the approach
2. **Pattern Reference**: Use reference docs to understand implementation patterns
3. **Decision Framework**: Use processes to inform workflow creation
4. **Best Practices**: Use processes to ensure consistency across implementations

### Creating Processes
1. **Charter Alignment**: Ensure processes align with governing charters
2. **Strategic Focus**: Focus on "why" and "what" rather than "how"
3. **Methodology Design**: Create frameworks that can be applied broadly
4. **Pattern Documentation**: Document reusable patterns and practices

### Updating Processes
1. **Impact Assessment**: Changes affect all workflows that use this process
2. **Version Control**: Update version numbers and change dates
3. **Workflow Updates**: Update dependent workflows when processes change
4. **Documentation**: Update all references and dependent documentation

## Cross-References

### Processes Reference These Documents
- **Charters**: Source of authority and principles
- **Paradigms**: Foundational mental models and approaches
- **Principles**: Core beliefs that inform methodologies

### Processes Are Used By
- **Workflows**: Implement processes as concrete procedures
- **All Service Domains**: Use methodologies for consistent approaches
- **Decision Making**: Reference processes for strategic choices
- **System Evolution**: Use improvement methodologies for growth

## Service Evolution

Future evolution of this service might include:
- **Stage 1**: Process modeling and relationship mapping
- **Stage 2**: Process database with impact tracking
- **Stage 3**: Integration with workflow generation tools
- **Stage 4**: AI-powered process optimization and methodology evolution

## Relationship to Other Domains

### Complementary Domains
- **[Workflows](../workflows/)**: Implements processes as executable procedures
- **[Charters](../charters/)**: Provides governing principles for all processes
- **[Paradigms](../paradigms/)**: Provides foundational mental models

### Dependent Domains
- **All Service Domains**: Use methodologies for consistent approaches
- **Workflows Service**: Implements processes as concrete workflows
- **Evolution Service**: Uses improvement methodologies for system growth

## Current Process Categories

### Methodologies
Documents ending in `.methodology.md` that define strategic approaches:
- High-level frameworks for organizing work
- Principles for separating execution from improvement
- Approaches for continuous learning and evolution

### Reference Documentation
Documents ending in `.reference.md` that provide implementation guidance:
- Pattern libraries and best practices
- Detailed specifications for implementation
- Reference guides for specific technical domains

*This domain provides the strategic thinking and reference patterns that inform how work is executed across the Company OS. It bridges the gap between high-level principles and concrete implementation.*
