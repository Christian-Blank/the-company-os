# Rules Service Domain

The rules service manages operational rules and governance guidelines derived from charter documents. Rules provide specific, actionable guidance for how to work within the Company OS while maintaining alignment with charter principles.

## Service Information
- **Evolution Stage**: 0 (File-based)
- **Service Registry**: [OS Services](../registry/data/services.registry.md)
- **Governing Charter**: [Service Architecture](../charters/data/service-architecture.charter.md)

## Structure

### [data/](data/) - Rules Documents
Operational rules governing different aspects of the system:

#### System Architecture Rules
- **[Service System Rules](data/service-system.rules.md)** - Rules for creating, evolving, and managing service domains
  - *Derived from*: [Service Architecture Charter](../charters/data/service-architecture.charter.md)
  - *Governs*: All service domain operations and evolution

- **[Repository System Rules](data/repository-system.rules.md)** - Rules for file organization and repository structure
  - *Derived from*: [Repository Architecture Charter](../charters/data/repository-architecture.charter.md)
  - *Governs*: File placement, directory structure, migration patterns

#### Knowledge Management Rules
- **[Knowledge System Rules](data/knowledge-system.rules.md)** - Rules for creating and maintaining knowledge documents
  - *Derived from*: [Knowledge Architecture Charter](../charters/data/knowledge-architecture.charter.md)
  - *Governs*: Document creation, metadata, linking, navigation

### [docs/](docs/) - Supporting Documentation
*Currently empty - ready for rules-related documentation*

## Rules Hierarchy

## Application Domains

These rules govern operations across:
- **Service Development**: Service creation, evolution, boundaries
- **File Organization**: Document placement, naming, structure
- **Knowledge Management**: Documentation standards, metadata, linking
- **Cross-Domain Operations**: Service communication, shared resources

## Working with Rules

### Using Rules
1. **Find Applicable Rules**: Use domain-specific rules for guidance
2. **Check Charter Context**: Understand the principles behind rules
3. **Follow Process**: Apply rules within [Synapse Methodology](../processes/data/synapse.methodology.md)

### Updating Rules
1. **Charter Alignment**: Ensure changes align with governing charters
2. **Impact Assessment**: Consider all domains affected by rule changes
3. **Version Control**: Update version numbers and change dates
4. **Process Flow**: Follow Synapse Methodology for rule evolution

## Cross-References

### Rules Reference These Documents
- **Charters**: Source of authority and principles
- **Processes**: [Synapse Methodology](../processes/data/synapse.methodology.md) for change management
- **Registry**: [Services Registry](../registry/data/services.registry.md) for service discovery

### Rules Are Used By
- **All Service Domains**: Operational guidance for daily work
- **Infrastructure**: Deployment and operational patterns
- **Shared Resources**: Cross-cutting concern management

## Service Evolution

Future evolution of this service might include:
- **Stage 1**: Rules validation API, compliance checking
- **Stage 2**: Rules database with dependency tracking
- **Stage 3**: Integration with development tools for automatic compliance
- **Stage 4**: AI-powered rules interpretation and guidance system
