# **Paradigms**

This directory contains the foundational mental models that form the conceptual architecture of the Company OS. These documents are the "deep why" behind our systems, rules, and methodologies.

## **What is a Paradigm?**

A paradigm document (`.paradigm.md`) is a deep dive into a core concept, foundational belief, or a fundamental "way of seeing" the system.

It is used when the **spirit, intent, and reasoning** behind a design cannot be fully captured by a list of rules or a linear process. Paradigms provide the rich context needed for both humans and AI agents to make intelligent, aligned decisions, especially when faced with novel situations. They are the source of intuition for the OS.

## **How to Use This Directory**

* **To Understand the "Why"**: Start here to understand the foundational thinking that governs the entire OS. These documents are the best entry point for grasping the system's core philosophy.
* **To Gain Deeper Context**: Refer to these documents when a `charter` or `methodology` seems abstract or lacks context. A paradigm provides the reasoning that informed the creation of those more specific documents.
* **To Guide New Designs**: Use these paradigms as a source of inspiration and a strategic guide when proposing new systems, charters, or significant changes to the OS.

## **Current Paradigms (v1.0)**

* [**The System Archetypes**](./system-archetypes.paradigm.md): Explains the conceptual building blocks of the OS (Charters, Principles, Methodologies, etc.) and the "star map" of how they relate to one another.

## **Contributing a New Paradigm**

New paradigms emerge as our understanding of the system deepens. They represent a significant evolution in our thinking and are not created lightly. The process for contributing a new paradigm is as follows:

1.  **Identify the Need**: A new paradigm is typically needed when a recurring problem reveals a gap in our core understanding or when a powerful new way of thinking emerges. This should be captured in one or more **Signal Records**.
2.  **Create an Opportunity Brief**: The signals should be synthesized into a formal `brief.md` that argues for the necessity of the new paradigm.
3.  **Approval**: The brief must be reviewed and approved by the **OS Core Team**.
4.  **Create the Document**: Upon approval, create the new `name.paradigm.md` file, add it to this directory, and update this README to include it in the list.
