# **Workflow: Agent Initialization**

This workflow provides a universal onboarding process for AI agents, humans, and any other collaborators joining the Company OS. It ensures consistent context loading and system understanding before task-specific work begins.

---

## **Overview**

This workflow establishes the foundational knowledge and context required for effective collaboration within the Company OS. It is task-independent and should be completed before any specific work instructions are provided.

### **Input**: New agent or human collaborator
### **Output**: Fully contextualized agent ready for task assignment
### **Duration**: 10-15 minutes for AI agents, 30-60 minutes for humans

---

## **Phase 1: System Context Loading**

### **Step 1.1: Load Core System Context**

1. **Primary Context Document**: Read and understand [LLM-CONTEXT.md](../../../LLM-CONTEXT.md)
   - This is the comprehensive system overview
   - Contains all essential vision, principles, and mental models
   - Provides current state and achievements

2. **Verify Context Understanding**:
   - **System Purpose**: Can you explain the Company OS vision in one sentence?
   - **Core Philosophy**: What are the three main philosophical pillars?
   - **Current State**: What major systems are operational vs. in development?

**Checkpoint**: Confirm understanding of system overview before proceeding.

### **Step 1.2: Understand Service Architecture**

1. **Read Service Charter**: [Service Architecture Charter](../charters/data/service-architecture.charter.md)
   - Understand the domain-based organization
   - Learn the distinction between OS services and Work services
   - Understand evolution stages (0-4)

2. **Navigate Service Boundaries**:
   - **OS Services**: `/company_os/domains/` - Core system services
   - **Work Services**: `/work/domains/` - Execution services
   - **Shared Resources**: `/shared/` - Cross-cutting resources

**Checkpoint**: Can you navigate to the correct domain for different types of work?

---

## **Phase 2: Principle and Paradigm Understanding**

### **Step 2.1: First Principles Mastery**

1. **Review Core Principles**: As listed in [LLM-CONTEXT.md](../../../LLM-CONTEXT.md)
   - Shared, Explicit Memory
   - Fluid Co-Development & Role Exchange
   - Process-First, Tools-Second
   - Context Over Compliance (The Dual Path)
   - Self-Evolution via Double Learning Loop
   - Effectiveness is the Measure of Truth

2. **Deep Dive on Key Principles**:
   - **Dual Path Principle**: Read [Dual Path Principle](../principles/data/dual-flow.principle.md)
   - **System Archetypes**: Read [System Archetypes Paradigm](../paradigms/data/system-archetypes.paradigm.md)

**Checkpoint**: Can you explain how these principles affect daily work decisions?

### **Step 2.2: Mental Model Alignment**

1. **Understand Key Paradigms**:
   - **Company as Code**: Everything is version-controlled and explicit
   - **Charter Hierarchy**: Governance flows from charters down
   - **Double Learning Loop**: Execution separate from improvement
   - **Signal Intelligence**: Continuous organizational learning

2. **Internalize the Cycle of Emergence**:
   - Signals → Insights → Actions → Memory → Smarter System

**Checkpoint**: Can you describe how work and improvement are separated?

---

## **Phase 3: Current State Assessment**

### **Step 3.1: System Status Review**

1. **Check Service Registry**: [Services Registry](../registry/data/services.registry.md)
   - Which services are operational?
   - Which are in development?
   - What are current evolution stages?

2. **Review Active Work**:
   - **Current Projects**: Browse [Projects](../../../work/domains/projects/data/)
   - **Recent Signals**: Check [Signals](../../../work/domains/signals/data/)
   - **Recent Decisions**: Review [Decisions](../../../work/domains/decisions/data/)

**Checkpoint**: What are the top 3 active initiatives in the system?

### **Step 3.2: Priority Understanding**

1. **Identify Current Priorities**:
   - What work is marked as "high priority" or "critical"?
   - Which signals have "high" or "critical" severity?
   - What decisions are pending or recently made?

2. **Understand Context Dependencies**:
   - Are there any system-wide changes in progress?
   - Are there any deprecated patterns being phased out?
   - Are there any new standards being adopted?

**Checkpoint**: Can you identify what should be prioritized in case of competing demands?

---

## **Phase 4: Navigation and Tool Mastery**

### **Step 4.1: Learn Navigation Patterns**

1. **Domain Navigation**:
   - Each domain has a README.md for navigation
   - Follow the `/domains/service_name/` structure
   - Use `data/` for content, `docs/` for documentation

2. **Document Type Recognition**:
   - Learn file naming: `name.type.md`
   - Understand document types: charter, rules, workflow, methodology, etc.
   - Practice identifying document types from filenames

**Checkpoint**: Can you find the rules for any given document type?

### **Step 4.2: Tool and Process Orientation**

1. **Understand Available Tools**:
   - **Rules Service**: Document validation and rule enforcement
   - **Pre-commit Hooks**: Automated quality checks
   - **Signal System**: Friction and opportunity capture
   - **Decision Records**: Transparent decision making

2. **Learn Key Processes**:
   - **Synapse Methodology**: [Synapse Methodology](../processes/data/synapse.methodology.md)
   - **Document Validation**: [Markdown Validation](markdown-validation.workflow.md)
   - **Standardization**: [Document Standardization](document-standardization.workflow.md)

**Checkpoint**: Can you create a signal or validate a document?

---

## **Phase 5: Collaboration Preparation**

### **Step 5.1: Understand Collaboration Model**

1. **Human-AI Partnership**:
   - AI agents and humans are equal peers
   - Roles are fluid based on capability
   - Handoffs should be seamless
   - Context must be preserved across transitions

2. **Working Patterns**:
   - **Synapse Methodology**: Separate execution from improvement
   - **Signal Intelligence**: Capture learnings continuously
   - **Charter Alignment**: All work traces to governing principles
   - **Evidence-Based**: Decisions based on signals, not opinions

**Checkpoint**: Can you explain the human-AI collaboration model?

### **Step 5.2: Communication Standards**

1. **Documentation Standards**:
   - All context must be explicit and documented
   - Use appropriate document types for different content
   - Follow frontmatter and structure requirements
   - Link related documents appropriately

2. **Signal Creation**:
   - Capture friction, opportunities, and insights
   - Use appropriate signal types and severity levels
   - Provide specific examples and evidence
   - Link to relevant context and decisions

**Checkpoint**: Can you create a well-structured signal document?

## **Notes**

### **Continuous Improvement**
This workflow evolves based on:
- **Agent feedback** on initialization experience
- **Task performance** after initialization
- **System changes** that affect context requirements
- **New tools** and processes that need introduction

### **Customization**
While this workflow provides universal initialization, it can be customized for:
- **Specific domains** (additional domain-specific context)
- **Role-specific needs** (developer vs. user vs. analyst)
- **Task complexity** (simple vs. complex task preparation)
- **Experience level** (new vs. returning collaborators)
