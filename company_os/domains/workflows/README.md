# Workflows Service Domain

The workflows service manages concrete, step-by-step, executable procedures that define how specific tasks are performed within the Company OS. Workflows are the tactical implementation of strategic approaches defined in methodologies.

## Service Information
- **Evolution Stage**: 0 (File-based)
- **Service Registry**: [OS Services](../registry/data/services.registry.md)
- **Governing Charter**: [Service Architecture](../charters/data/service-architecture.charter.md)

## Structure

### [data/](data/) - Workflow Documents
Concrete, executable procedures for specific tasks:

#### Core System Workflows
- **[Document Standardization](data/document-standardization.workflow.md)** - Process for reviewing and standardizing document compliance
  - *Governs*: Document quality assurance, auto-fixing, human input handling
  - *Used by*: All document creation and maintenance activities

- **[Agent Initialization](data/agent-initialization.workflow.md)** - Universal onboarding process for AI agents and humans
  - *Governs*: System context loading, principle understanding, task preparation
  - *Used by*: All new agent sessions and task handoffs

- **[Markdown Validation](data/markdown-validation.workflow.md)** - Document validation and fixing process
  - *Governs*: Schema discovery, validation execution, auto-fixing, human input
  - *Used by*: Pre-commit hooks, CI/CD pipelines, manual validation

### [docs/](docs/) - Supporting Documentation
*Currently empty - ready for workflow-related documentation*

## Workflows vs Processes

### Workflows (This Domain)
- **Purpose**: Concrete, step-by-step, executable procedures
- **Properties**: Actionable, sequential, stateful, replayable
- **Examples**: Document validation steps, agent initialization checklist, standardization process
- **Usage**: Direct execution by humans or AI agents

### Processes ([../processes/](../processes/))
- **Purpose**: Strategic frameworks and reference documentation
- **Properties**: Methodologies, patterns, best practices
- **Examples**: Synapse methodology, validation patterns, architectural principles
- **Usage**: Guidance for creating workflows and making decisions

## Working with Workflows

### Using Workflows
1. **Find Applicable Workflow**: Use domain-specific workflows for guidance
2. **Follow Steps Sequentially**: Workflows are designed to be followed in order
3. **Track State**: Many workflows involve state management and checkpoints
4. **Report Results**: Workflows often produce outputs or reports

### Creating Workflows
1. **Charter Alignment**: Ensure workflows align with governing charters
2. **Methodology Basis**: Base workflows on established methodologies
3. **Sequential Steps**: Break down into clear, actionable steps
4. **Error Handling**: Include failure modes and recovery steps
5. **Testing**: Validate workflows through execution

### Updating Workflows
1. **Version Control**: Update version numbers and change dates
2. **Impact Assessment**: Consider all users affected by workflow changes
3. **Documentation**: Update related documentation and cross-references
4. **Process Flow**: Follow Synapse Methodology for workflow evolution

## Cross-References

### Workflows Reference These Documents
- **Charters**: Source of authority and principles
- **Methodologies**: Strategic frameworks ([Synapse](../processes/data/synapse.methodology.md))
- **Rules**: Specific constraints and requirements
- **Templates**: Document templates for workflow outputs

### Workflows Are Used By
- **All Service Domains**: Execution guidance for daily work
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Automated workflow execution
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automated validation and processing
- **Agent Systems**: AI agent task execution

## Service Evolution

Future evolution of this service might include:
- **Stage 1**: Workflow execution API, state management
- **Stage 2**: Workflow database with dependency tracking
- **Stage 3**: Integration with development tools for automatic execution
- **Stage 4**: AI-powered workflow optimization and adaptation system

## Relationship to Other Domains

### Complementary Domains
- **[Processes](../processes/)**: Provides methodologies that inform workflow design
- **[Rules](../rules/)**: Provides constraints that workflows must respect
- **[Charters](../charters/)**: Provides governing principles for all workflows

### Dependent Domains
- **All Service Domains**: Use workflows for consistent execution
- **Rules Service**: Uses workflows for validation and processing
- **Evolution Service**: Uses workflows for system improvement processes
