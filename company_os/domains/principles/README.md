# **Principles**

This directory contains detailed, canonical explanations of the First Principles that govern the Company OS. While the principles are listed in our Charters, the documents here provide the deep context, rationale, and examples for each one.

## **What is a Principle Document?**

A principle document (`.principle.md`) is a deep dive into a single, non-negotiable "law" of our system. Its purpose is to ensure that the spirit and intent behind each principle are understood by all collaborators, both human and AI.

They answer the question: *"What does this principle truly mean, and why is it immutable?"*

## **How to Use This Directory**

* **To Understand Our Foundations**: This is the source of truth for the core beliefs that shape all our decisions, methodologies, and processes.
* **To Justify Decisions**: When making a difficult trade-off, refer to these documents to ensure your decision is aligned with our foundational values.
* **To Challenge the System (Correctly)**: According to our "Effectiveness is the Measure of Truth" principle, even these principles can be challenged. Any such challenge must begin with a thorough understanding of the document presented here.

## **Current Principles (v1.0)**

* [**The Dual-Path Process**](./dual-path.principle.md): Explains why every process must support both a guided and expert path to balance structure with autonomy.
* *More principle documents will be added as they are formally extracted and detailed.*

## **Contributing or Evolving a Principle**

First Principles are the most stable part of our OS. Changing them is a profound event.

* **Detailing an Existing Principle**: Any First Principle listed in a Charter can have a corresponding `.principle.md` file created here to add clarity. This is encouraged.
* **Changing a Principle**: Evolving a First Principle requires triggering the evolution process for the root `company-os.charter.md` itself. It is the most significant change one can make to the system.
