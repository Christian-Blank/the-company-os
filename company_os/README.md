# **Company OS: The Intelligent Operating System**

Welcome to the Company OS - a self-evolving, intelligent operating system that acts as a living partner for organizations. This directory contains the core system services that power the entire OS.

## **Quick Start**

- **New to Company OS?** Start with the [Company OS Charter](domains/charters/data/company-os.charter.md)
- **Looking for a specific service?** Check the [Services Registry](domains/registry/data/services.registry.md)
- **Want to contribute?** Follow the [Synapse Methodology](domains/processes/data/synapse.methodology.md)
- **Setting up AI agents?** Use the [Agent Initialization Workflow](domains/workflows/data/agent-initialization.workflow.md)

## **Core Philosophy**

The Company OS operates on three fundamental beliefs:
1. **A Living System**: Organizations are complex adaptive systems that balance order and chaos
2. **A Symbiotic Partnership**: Humans and AI work as equal peers with unique capabilities
3. **An Engine for Clarity**: Turning ambiguity into order through transparent, deterministic processes

## **System Architecture**

### **Core Services (OS Boundary)**

The `/company_os/` directory contains foundational services organized by domain:

#### **Governance & Vision**
- **[Charters](domains/charters/)** - Constitutional documents defining vision and principles
- **[Rules](domains/rules/)** - Operational rules derived from charters
- **[Principles](domains/principles/)** - Deep explanations of first principles
- **[Paradigms](domains/paradigms/)** - Foundational mental models

#### **Knowledge & Documentation**
- **[Knowledge](domains/knowledge/)** - System memory and knowledge graph
- **[Registry](domains/registry/)** - Service discovery and status tracking

#### **Execution & Evolution**
- **[Workflows](domains/workflows/)** - Step-by-step executable procedures
- **[Processes](domains/processes/)** - Strategic methodologies and frameworks
- **[Evolution](domains/evolution/)** - System improvement mechanisms
- **[Rules Service](domains/rules_service/)** - Automated rule management (Stage 0 Complete)

#### **System Support**
- **[Configuration](domains/configuration/)** - Agent and system configuration
- **[Maintenance Service](domains/maintenance_service/)** - System maintenance operations

## **Navigation Guide**

### **By Role**

**For System Architects:**
- Start with [Service Architecture Charter](domains/charters/data/service-architecture.charter.md)
- Review [Service System Rules](domains/rules/data/service-system.rules.md)
- Explore domain boundaries in [domains/](domains/)

**For Developers:**
- Follow [Synapse Methodology](domains/processes/data/synapse.methodology.md)
- Check [Repository System Rules](domains/rules/data/repository-system.rules.md)
- Use [Document Standardization Workflow](domains/workflows/data/document-standardization.workflow.md)

**For AI Agents:**
- Initialize with [Agent Initialization Workflow](domains/workflows/data/agent-initialization.workflow.md)
- Load context from [LLM-CONTEXT.md](../LLM-CONTEXT.md)
- Follow assigned workflows in [workflows/](domains/workflows/)

**For Charter Stewards:**
- Execute [Charter Stewardship Workflow](domains/workflows/data/charter-stewardship.workflow.md)
- Review all charters in [charters/](domains/charters/)
- Track improvements via stewardship reports

### **By Task**

**Creating New Services:**
1. Review [Service Architecture Charter](domains/charters/data/service-architecture.charter.md)
2. Follow [Service System Rules](domains/rules/data/service-system.rules.md)
3. Use [Synapse Methodology](domains/processes/data/synapse.methodology.md)
4. Register in [Services Registry](domains/registry/data/services.registry.md)

**Managing Documentation:**
1. Follow [Knowledge Architecture Charter](domains/charters/data/knowledge-architecture.charter.md)
2. Apply [Knowledge System Rules](domains/rules/data/knowledge-system.rules.md)
3. Use [Document Standardization Workflow](domains/workflows/data/document-standardization.workflow.md)

**Evolving the System:**
1. Capture signals in [work/domains/signals/](../work/domains/signals/)
2. Create briefs in [work/domains/briefs/](../work/domains/briefs/)
3. Follow [Evolution Architecture Charter](domains/charters/data/evolution-architecture.charter.md)

## **Service Evolution Stages**

All services evolve through measured friction, not arbitrary timelines:

- **Stage 0**: File-based (current state for most services)
- **Stage 1**: APIs and basic automation
- **Stage 2**: Database caching and optimization
- **Stage 3**: External integrations
- **Stage 4**: Full platform capabilities

### **Current Service Status**

| Service | Stage | Status | Key Achievement |
|---------|-------|--------|-----------------|
| Rules Service | 0 | âœ… Complete | Full automation, CLI, pre-commit hooks |
| Charters | 0 | Active | 11+ governance documents |
| Rules | 0 | Active | Comprehensive operational rules |
| Workflows | 0 | Active | Executable procedures |
| Processes | 0 | Active | Synapse methodology |
| Registry | 0 | Active | Service tracking |
| Others | 0 | Ready | Awaiting activation |

## **Key Resources**

### **Essential Documents**
- [Company OS Charter](domains/charters/data/company-os.charter.md) - Root governance
- [LLM-CONTEXT.md](../LLM-CONTEXT.md) - Complete AI agent context
- [DEVELOPER_WORKFLOW.md](../DEVELOPER_WORKFLOW.md) - Development guide
- [Services Registry](domains/registry/data/services.registry.md) - All services

### **Active Workflows**
- [Document Standardization](domains/workflows/data/document-standardization.workflow.md)
- [Agent Initialization](domains/workflows/data/agent-initialization.workflow.md)
- [Charter Stewardship](domains/workflows/data/charter-stewardship.workflow.md)
- [Markdown Validation](domains/workflows/data/markdown-validation.workflow.md)

## **Working with Company OS**

### **Core Principles to Remember**

1. **Shared, Explicit Memory**: All context must be documented
2. **Fluid Co-Development**: Humans and AI are equal partners
3. **Process-First, Tools-Second**: Define process before automation
4. **Context Over Compliance**: Understanding why matters most
5. **Self-Evolution**: Continuous improvement is built-in
6. **Effectiveness is Truth**: Measure and improve based on results

### **Getting Help**

- **Documentation Issues**: Create a signal in [work/domains/signals/](../work/domains/signals/)
- **Process Questions**: Consult [Synapse Methodology](domains/processes/data/synapse.methodology.md)
- **Charter Clarifications**: Review parent charters for context
- **Technical Support**: Check [DEVELOPER_WORKFLOW.md](../DEVELOPER_WORKFLOW.md)
