# Repo Guardian Evolution Log

## Overview

This log tracks the evolution of the Repo Guardian service, documenting changes, improvements, and lessons learned.

## Entries

### 2025-07-22: Service Genesis (v0.1.0)

**Context**: Initial creation of Repo Guardian service as part of the Company OS human-AI workflow foundation.

**Changes Made**:
- Created service charter aligned with Company OS principles
- Established hexagonal architecture with clear boundaries
- Set up Temporal workflow orchestration foundation
- Integrated dependencies: Temporal, OpenAI, Anthropic, GitHub
- Created comprehensive documentation structure

**Key Decisions**:
- Chose Temporal for workflow orchestration (deterministic, scalable, stateful)
- Adopted hexagonal architecture for clean separation of concerns
- Structured as Stage 0 (file-based) service with clear evolution path
- Designed for human-AI symbiotic partnership

**Metrics Baseline**:
- Service Stage: 0 (File-based)
- Dependencies: 6 (temporalio, openai, anthropic, prometheus-client, structlog, PyGithub)
- Code Coverage: TBD (tests in Phase 2)
- Complexity Score: Low (basic structure only)

**Lessons Learned**:
- Docker Compose configuration requires specific DB settings for Temporal
- Bazel build system works well with proper dependency management
- Clear charter definition essential for AI-human collaboration

**Next Evolution Triggers**:
- [ ] When workflow execution exceeds 100/day → Consider Stage 1 (API)
- [ ] When multiple services need Guardian data → Add MCP server
- [ ] When response time > 5s → Add caching layer
