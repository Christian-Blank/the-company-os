# **The Synapse Development Methodology**

This document outlines the unified methodology for all development within the Company OS. It operationalizes the principles defined in the `company-os.charter.md`. The journey of an individual project through this system is its **Emergent Path**.

---

## **1. The Governance Layer: The Charter System**

All work is governed by a hierarchy of **Charters**. Every new project or feature must be aligned with the principles and scope of its governing Charter. This ensures top-down strategic alignment.

---

## **2. The Execution Framework: The Double Learning Loop**

Our execution framework separates the process of doing work from the process of improving work. This is the engine that drives both task completion and system evolution.

### **2.1 The Meta Loop (Improvement & Emergence)**

This loop is focused on **improving the process itself** and is where new work **emerges**.

1.  **Sense (Continuous Capture)**: Any friction, problem, opportunity, or idea is captured as a **"Signal Record"** by any human or agent at any time. This creates the raw data stream for emergence.
2.  **Synthesize & Align**: An AI analyst or human team reviews the stream of signals to detect patterns. Significant opportunities are synthesized into a formal **Opportunity Brief** and aligned with a governing **Charter**.
3.  **Define**: The approved opportunity is defined as a new or updated **APN (Agentic Process Notation) Blueprint**. This act launches the Primary Loop.

### **2.2 The Primary Loop (Execution)**

This loop is focused on **completing a specific task** defined by an APN Blueprint. It operates on the **Dual-Path Process** model:

* **Build (The Dual Path)**: The task is executed by following either the default **Guided Path** for clarity or the **Expert Path** for velocity, based on the agent's capability.
* **Refactor & Complete**: Before a task is considered done, a mandatory refactoring step ensures the work is clean, integrated, and adheres to all system principles.

### **2.3 Closing the Loop**

Upon completion, the Primary Loop generates new data (e.g., task reflections, performance metrics). This data becomes new **Signal Records**, feeding back into the **Meta Loop** for future improvements and creating a virtuous cycle.

## **3. The Emergent Path: An Integrated Example**

The journey of a single idea demonstrates the entire methodology:

1.  **Signal**: A developer notices that API key generation is slow and creates a **Signal Record**.
2.  **Synthesize**: The weekly system review identifies this and several related signals. An **Opportunity Brief** to "Automate and Standardize API Key Generation" is created.
3.  **Align**: The brief is aligned with the "Internal Tooling" **Charter**.
4.  **Define**: A new process, `api-key-generation.apn.yaml`, is created. This launches the **Primary Loop**.
5.  **Execute**: An engineer (or AI agent) uses the **Expert Path** within the APN to build the new service.
6.  **Learn**: The new service's execution time is logged, creating a new, positive signal that **closes the Meta Loop**.
