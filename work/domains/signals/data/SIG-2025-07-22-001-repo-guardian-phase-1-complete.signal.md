## Signal Details

### What Happened
- Created comprehensive charter aligned with Company OS principles
- Set up complete project structure with hexagonal architecture
- Configured all dependencies (Temporal, OpenAI, Anthropic, GitHub)
- Established working Temporal development environment
- Created extensive documentation at all levels

### Evidence
- All Bazel builds passing: `bazel build //src/company_os/services/repo_guardian:repo_guardian`
- Temporal services running successfully via Docker Compose
- UI accessible at http://localhost:8080
