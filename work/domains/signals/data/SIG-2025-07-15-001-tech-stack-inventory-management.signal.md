# **Signal: Need for Tech Stack Inventory Management Service**

**Type**: opportunity  
**Severity**: high  
**Status**: new  
**Source**: Christian Blank  
**Context**: Tech stack rules creation and system standardization needs  
**Date Captured**: 2025-07-15

---

## **Description**

### **What Happened**
While creating the tech-stack.rules.md file, it became clear that we need a systematic way to manage our technology stack inventory. Currently, technology choices are scattered across manifest files (pyproject.toml, package.json), decision records, and implicit knowledge, making it difficult for both humans and AI agents to understand what technologies we use and why.

### **When & Where**
This need emerged during the creation of minimal tech stack rules as part of system standardization efforts.

### **Impact & Implications**
Without a centralized tech stack management approach:
- Duplicate packages may be introduced unnecessarily
- Technology decisions lack visibility and context
- AI agents cannot easily query current stack for implementation decisions
- Standardization opportunities are missed
- Inconsistencies go undetected until they cause friction

---

## **Evidence & Examples**

### **Specific Examples**
- Currently need to manually check pyproject.toml, package.json, and decision records to understand current stack
- No easy way for AI agents to query "what database libraries do we use?" or "what testing frameworks are standard?"
- Technology choices made in isolation without visibility into existing solutions
- No systematic tracking of dependency versions or update needs

### **Supporting Data**
- Multiple manifest files to check: pyproject.toml, package.json, potentially others as system grows
- Decision records scattered across different timeframes without tech stack categorization
- No centralized query interface for stack information

### **Related Documentation**
- [Service Architecture Charter](../../../os/domains/charters/data/service-architecture.charter.md): Supports service evolution based on measured pain
- [Tech Stack Rules](../../../os/domains/rules/data/tech-stack.rules.md): Newly created rules that assume existence of stack service
- [SIG-2025-07-14-001](SIG-2025-07-14-001-system-complexity-automation-need.signal.md): Related automation need for system maintenance

---

## **Analysis**

### **Root Cause**
Lack of a dedicated service/role for tech stack management as the system grows in complexity and the number of technology decisions increases.

### **Potential Solutions**
Implement a Tech Stack Management Service with multiple evolution stages:

1. **V0 - YAML Database Approach**:
   - Simple YAML file serving as stack inventory
   - Manual updates with automated validation
   - Queryable by agents and humans
   - Include package names, versions, purposes, decision links

2. **V1 - Automated Discovery Service**:
   - Service that scans manifest files automatically
   - Detects inconsistencies and missing entries
   - Generates signals for stack issues
   - API for programmatic querying

3. **V2 - Full Stack Management Platform**:
   - Dependency update monitoring
   - Security vulnerability tracking
   - Standardization recommendations
   - Integration with decision workflow

### **Charter Alignment**
Aligns with Service Architecture Charter's principle of evolving services based on measured friction. The friction of manual tech stack management is becoming apparent as the system grows.

## **Relationships**

### **Related Signals**
- [SIG-2025-07-14-001](SIG-2025-07-14-001-system-complexity-automation-need.signal.md): System complexity automation needs

### **Connected Systems**
- **Rules Service**: Tech stack rules depend on inventory service
- **Decisions Service**: Technology decisions need to update stack inventory
- **Projects Service**: New projects need to query stack for consistency
- **Evolution Service**: Stack evolution needs systematic tracking

### **Dependencies**
- Requires tech-stack.rules.md (just created)
- Could build on automation infrastructure from SIG-2025-07-14-001
- Should integrate with existing decision record workflow

## **Notes**

This signal represents a foundational infrastructure need that will support better technology governance and standardization across all future development. The V0 YAML approach provides immediate value with minimal implementation cost, following our "start simple, evolve on demand" principle.

The service would serve both humans (easy reference) and AI agents (programmatic querying) making it a multiplier for development efficiency and consistency.

Priority should be given to V0 implementation as it provides immediate value and can be implemented quickly while laying groundwork for future automation.
