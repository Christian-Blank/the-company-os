# **Signal: Missing Documentation Ownership and Systemic Drift**

**Type**: friction
**Severity**: high
**Status**: new
**Source**: Christian Blank
**Context**: Company OS Documentation & Navigation System
**Date Captured**: 2025-07-16

---

## **Description**

There are broken, outdated, or missing links in the `README.md`, which points to pages that have either been moved, renamed, or never existed. This is a recurring source of friction and disorientation, especially for new contributors or AI agents relying on documentation as ground truth.

This signal highlights a broader systemic issue: documentation lacks a clear ownership model and governing structure, leading to entropy, duplication, drift, and degraded quality over time.

### **What Happened**

- The root `README.md` references documentation pages that cannot be found or return 404s.
- No defined owner or review process exists to detect or resolve such issues proactively.
- Attempts to access system knowledge result in confusion or delay, especially for AI workflows relying on path-based discovery.

### **When & Where**

- Encountered during documentation walkthrough and initial setup of signal-intelligence architecture.
- Present across core navigation touchpoints, including `/README.md`, `/docs`, and `/navigation`.

### **Impact & Implications**

- Increases cognitive load for contributors trying to understand or modify the system.
- Prevents AI agents from functioning reliably based on file-linked documentation.
- Deteriorates trust in the integrity of the documentation system.
- Violates the principle of "Capture Everything, Lose Nothing" and the OS knowledge architecture charter.

---

## **Evidence & Examples**

### **Specific Examples**

- `README.md` links to pages like `navigation.md` and `doc-system.md` that do not exist.
- Previous documentation decisions (e.g. naming, page movements) not reflected in navigational indexes.

### **Supporting Data**

- Frequency: Recurring issue; README link rot observed across multiple iterations.
- Impact: >2 hours/week lost to context gathering for AI agent and contributor setup.

### **Related Documentation**

- [`signal-intelligence.vision.md`](../../projects/data/signal-intelligence.vision.md)
- [`knowledge-architecture.charter.md`](../../../charters/data/knowledge-architecture.charter.md)

## **Analysis**

### **Root Cause**

- Lack of a Dedicated Responsible Individual (DRI) for documentation governance.
- No process for validating links or reviewing changes to documentation structure.
- Missing systems for ensuring documentation accuracy, integrity, and evolution over time.

### **Potential Solutions**

1. **Establish a DRI for Documentation**:
   - Owns architecture, principles, systems, and tools for documentation.
   - Starts as expert, architect, and gatekeeper until responsibilities scale out to sub-DRIs.

2. **Create Documentation Governance Rules**:
   - Define responsibilities, quality standards, review cadences, and change boundaries.

3. **Tooling and AI Agent Support**:
   - Introduce link validators, missing page detectors, and auto-generators for navigation or backreferences.
   - Empower contributors with low-friction tools that integrate into their flow.

4. **Signal-Driven Emergence**:
   - Use continuous signal capture to evolve and improve documentation practices based on actual breakdowns.

### **Charter Alignment**

- Directly supports the **Knowledge Architecture Charter**: building a durable, queryable, and trustworthy knowledge system.
- Reinforces **Signal Intelligence System**: reduces entropy and surfaces emergent needs from the systemâ€™s own breakdowns.

## **Relationships**

### **Related Signals**

- None currently linked, but similar navigation friction expected to emerge.

### **Connected Systems**

- `signal-intelligence`
- `navigation-system`
- `rules-service`
- `doc-discovery-system` (planned)

### **Dependencies**

- Governance rules for documentation ownership
- Signal-to-brief process for prioritization
- AI agent instrumentation in editing and navigation flows

## **Notes**

This signal is a foundational example of how minor visible frictions (e.g., broken README links) point to systemic architectural gaps. It serves as a seed for developing the documentation architecture, governance rules, and agent augmentation roadmap in alignment with the Signal Intelligence System.
