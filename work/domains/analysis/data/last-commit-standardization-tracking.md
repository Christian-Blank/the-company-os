# **Tracking: Last Commit Document Standardization**

## **Summary**

This tracking document captures the standardization work performed on files from the last git commit (HEAD) on 2025-07-17. All files have been reviewed, non-compliant files have been fixed, and signals have been created for missing standards.

## **Files Reviewed**

### **Git Commit HEAD Files**
```
company_os/domains/charters/data/apn.charter.md
company_os/domains/paradigms/README.md
company_os/domains/paradigms/data/system-archetypes.paradigm.md
company_os/domains/principles/README.md
company_os/domains/principles/data/dual-flow.principle.md
work/domains/analysis/data/system-primitives.analysis.md
work/domains/briefs/data/BRIEF-2025-07-17-001-human-agentic-workflow-brief-apn.brief.md
```

## **Compliance Status**

| File | Initial Status | Issues | Actions Taken | Final Status |
|------|---------------|--------|---------------|--------------|
| apn.charter.md | ✅ Compliant | None | None needed | ✅ Compliant |
| paradigms/README.md | ✅ Compliant | None | None needed | ✅ Compliant |
| system-archetypes.paradigm.md | ✅ Compliant | None | None needed | ✅ Compliant |
| principles/README.md | ✅ Compliant | None | None needed | ✅ Compliant |
| dual-flow.principle.md | ✅ Compliant | None | None needed | ✅ Compliant |
| system-primitives.analysis.md | ❌ Non-compliant | Missing frontmatter | Added standard frontmatter | ✅ Fixed |
| BRIEF-2025-07-17-001...brief.md | ✅ Compliant | None | None needed | ✅ Compliant |

**Final Result**: All files are now compliant ✅

## **Standards Gaps Identified**

### **Missing Document Type Standards**

1. **`.analysis.md`**
   - Status: No documented standard
   - Action: Created SIG-2025-07-17-001
   - Proposed standard documented in signal

2. **`.paradigm.md`**
   - Status: Pattern exists but not documented
   - Action: Created SIG-2025-07-17-002
   - Clear pattern already in use

3. **`.principle.md`**
   - Status: Pattern exists but not documented
   - Action: Created SIG-2025-07-17-002
   - Clear pattern already in use

## **Signals Created**

1. **SIG-2025-07-17-001**: Missing Documentation Standard for Analysis Documents
   - Severity: Medium
   - Type: Opportunity
   - Focus: Need to add `.analysis.md` to knowledge-system rules

2. **SIG-2025-07-17-002**: Missing Documentation Standards for Paradigm and Principle Documents
   - Severity: Medium
   - Type: Opportunity
   - Focus: Need to add `.paradigm.md` and `.principle.md` to knowledge-system rules

## **Artifacts Created**

1. **Document Standardization Workflow v0** (`document-standardization-workflow.analysis.md`)
   - Comprehensive workflow for future standardization efforts
   - Includes methodology, decision framework, and tracking templates
   - Will serve as the foundation for automated standardization

2. **Standardized Analysis Document** (`system-primitives.analysis.md`)
   - Added proper frontmatter
   - Now serves as example of `.analysis.md` format

## **Next Steps**

### **Immediate Actions**
1. Update `knowledge-system.rules.md` to include new document types
2. Update rules service validation to handle new types
3. Create templates for each document type

### **Future Improvements**
1. Automate frontmatter generation
2. Add pre-commit hooks for new document types
3. Create document type detection logic
4. Build auto-fix capabilities for common issues

## **Patterns Observed**

### **Naming Conventions**
- All files follow `name.type.md` pattern ✅
- New types discovered: `.analysis.md`, `.paradigm.md`, `.principle.md`

### **Frontmatter Consistency**
- Standard fields used across all compliant documents:
  - title (with "Type: Description" format)
  - version (typically 1.0 for new documents)
  - status (Draft|Active|Deprecated)
  - owner
  - last_updated (ISO 8601 with timezone)
  - parent_charter
  - tags

### **Document Structure**
- Clear markdown hierarchy (# for title, ## for sections)
- Consistent section patterns by document type
- README files have specific structure for directory documentation

## **Lessons Learned**

1. **New document types emerge organically** - Need process for capturing and formalizing
2. **Most issues are frontmatter-related** - Strong candidate for automation
3. **Clear patterns exist** - Even undocumented types follow consistent patterns
4. **Documentation debt accumulates quickly** - Need regular standardization sweeps

## **Success Metrics**

- **Files Reviewed**: 7
- **Files Fixed**: 1
- **Compliance Rate**: 100% (after fixes)
- **New Standards Identified**: 3
- **Signals Created**: 2
- **Time Invested**: ~30 minutes
