# Decisions Service Domain

The decisions service captures the rationale, context, and consequences of all significant decisions made during Company OS development. These decision records are critical knowledge nodes that enable deterministic system understanding and support the self-evolving nature of the OS.

## Service Information
- **Evolution Stage**: 0 (File-based)
- **Service Registry**: [Work Services](../../../os/domains/registry/data/services.registry.md)
- **Governing Charter**: [Knowledge Architecture](../../../os/domains/charters/data/knowledge-architecture.charter.md)
- **Operational Rules**: [Decision System Rules](../../../os/domains/rules/data/decision-system.rules.md)
- **Development Process**: [Synapse Methodology](../../../os/domains/processes/data/synapse.methodology.md)

## Structure

### [data/](data/) - Decision Records
Active decision records and templates:

#### Template & Examples
- **[Decision Template](data/decision-template.md)** - Comprehensive template for creating new decision records
- **[DEC-2025-07-14-001](data/DEC-2025-07-14-001-decision-record-structure.decision.md)** - First decision record establishing the decision record structure (serves as working example)

#### Decision Record Format
All decision records follow the naming convention: `DEC-YYYY-MM-DD-NNN-brief-description.decision.md`

### [docs/](docs/) - Supporting Documentation
*Currently empty - ready for decision-related documentation, guides, and analysis*

## Purpose & Philosophy

### Deterministic System Understanding
Decision records enable anyone (human or AI) to:
- Understand why decisions were made
- Reconstruct the logical decision path
- Identify when decisions should be reconsidered
- Learn from decision outcomes

### Integration with Learning Loops

#### Double Learning Loop Connection
**Meta Loop (System Improvement)**:
- **Signals** → **Analysis** → **Decisions** → **Implementation** → **New Signals**

**Primary Loop (Task Execution)**:
- Project decisions generate outcomes that become learning signals

#### Cross-Service Integration
- **From Signals**: Decision records reference triggering signal records
- **From Briefs**: Decisions implement approved opportunity briefs
- **To Projects**: Decisions guide project execution
- **To Evolution**: Decision outcomes inform system improvement

## Decision Lifecycle

### Status Progression
1. **proposed** → Decision under consideration
2. **accepted** → Decision approved and active
3. **deprecated** → No longer recommended (if naturally superseded)
4. **superseded** → Explicitly replaced by newer decision

### Key Principles
- **Never Delete**: All decisions remain as historical record
- **Complete Context**: Capture all signals, constraints, assumptions
- **Options Analysis**: Document alternatives with pros/cons
- **Measurable Outcomes**: Define success metrics and review triggers

## Working with Decisions

### Creating Decision Records

1. **Before Starting**: 
   - Run `date` command to verify current timestamp
   - Review [Decision System Rules](../../../os/domains/rules/data/decision-system.rules.md)
   - Copy [Decision Template](data/decision-template.md)

2. **Required Information**:
   - All triggering signals that led to the decision
   - Complete problem statement and constraints
   - At least 2 options with detailed analysis
   - Clear rationale for selection
   - Implementation plan and success metrics

3. **File Naming**: `DEC-YYYY-MM-DD-NNN-brief-description.decision.md`
   - Use sequential number (NNN) for decisions on same day
   - Keep brief-description short but descriptive

### Referencing Decisions
- Link to decisions from projects, signals, and other decisions
- Use decision ID (DEC-YYYY-MM-DD-NNN) for stable references
- Reference decisions when making related choices

### Reviewing Decisions
- Monitor against defined success metrics
- Generate signals when decision outcomes indicate need for change
- Create superseding decisions rather than modifying original records

## Integration Patterns

### With Signals Service
- **Input**: Signals provide the data that triggers decision need
- **Output**: Decision implementation generates new signals about effectiveness

### With Briefs Service  
- **Input**: Approved opportunity briefs often require implementation decisions
- **Cross-reference**: Link decisions to the briefs they implement

### With Projects Service
- **Integration**: Project execution involves many decisions
- **Documentation**: Capture key project decisions for future reference

### With Charter Service
- **Governance**: All decisions must align with governing charter principles
- **Reference**: Explicitly link to parent charter in each decision

## Service Evolution

### Stage 0 (Current): Structured Files
- Markdown files with comprehensive frontmatter
- Manual creation using template
- Git-based version control and history

### Stage 1: Decision API
- Programmatic decision creation and retrieval
- Validation of required fields and format
- Integration with other service APIs

### Stage 2: Decision Database
- Query capabilities across decision history
- Dependency tracking and impact analysis
- Automated review trigger monitoring

### Stage 3: Decision Intelligence
- Pattern analysis across decisions
- AI-assisted decision option generation
- Predictive modeling for decision outcomes

### Stage 4: Autonomous Decision Support
- Real-time decision recommendation
- Automatic signal-to-decision correlation
- Self-improving decision quality metrics

## Best Practices

### For Decision Creators
1. **Be Comprehensive**: Include all context needed for future understanding
2. **Link Extensively**: Reference all related signals, briefs, projects, and charters
3. **Think Deterministically**: Someone should be able to reach the same decision from your record
4. **Define Success**: Specify measurable outcomes and review triggers
5. **Follow Rules**: Adhere strictly to [Decision System Rules](../../../os/domains/rules/data/decision-system.rules.md)

### For Decision Users
1. **Check Existing Decisions**: Avoid re-deciding already-settled issues
2. **Reference Appropriately**: Link to relevant decisions in your work
3. **Generate Signals**: Capture outcomes and effectiveness as new signals
4. **Respect Status**: Honor deprecated/superseded decisions appropriately

## Examples & Templates

- **[Decision Template](data/decision-template.md)** - Start here for new decisions
- **[First Decision Record](data/DEC-2025-07-14-001-decision-record-structure.decision.md)** - Example of complete decision documentation
- **Meta-Decision**: Note how the decision to create decision records is itself documented as a decision

This self-referential approach demonstrates the system's commitment to transparency and deterministic understanding.
