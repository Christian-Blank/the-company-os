# **Decision: Establish Decision Record Structure for Company OS**

**Status**: accepted
**Decision ID**: DEC-2025-07-14-001
**Date Decided**: 2025-07-14
**Deciders**: OS Core Team, Cline AI

---

## **Context**

### **Problem Statement**
The Company OS lacked a formal structure for capturing decision rationale, context, and consequences. This created a risk of tribal knowledge accumulation and prevented deterministic system understanding - the ability to reconstruct and understand why decisions were made based solely on recorded information.

### **Triggering Signals**
- **User Request Signal**: Direct user request: "Where and how should we store decision records that contain the why and what as we develop the os to make sure we capture all data and context that lead to decisions, so we can deterministically 'rebuild' the system coming to the same key decisions based on the records"
- **Self-Evolution Requirement**: Company OS charter principle requiring the system to be self-evolving with open state
- **Company as Code Paradigm**: Need for all decisions to be explicit and traceable for the "company as code" vision

### **Constraints**
- **Technical**: Must work within current Stage 0 (file-based) architecture
- **Resource**: Implementation must be achievable with current tooling and processes
- **Business**: Must integrate with existing Synapse methodology and Double Learning Loop
- **Philosophical**: Must align with Knowledge Architecture Charter principles of Git as source of truth, atomic documents, and explicit metadata

### **Assumptions**
- Decision records will be stored as markdown files with structured frontmatter
- The Synapse methodology provides the framework for when decisions are made
- Future system evolution will build upon but not replace this foundational structure
- Both human and AI agents will need to create and use decision records

### **Environment State**
- **System Version**: Company OS repository at commit 4d625d1 with service-oriented architecture migration complete
- **Team Composition**: OS Core Team with AI assistant (Cline) for implementation
- **External Factors**: Active development phase with rapid system evolution requiring decision capture
- **Dependencies**:
  - Service-oriented architecture already established
  - Knowledge system rules already defined
  - Work boundary services (including decisions service) already structured

---

## **Options Considered**

### **Option A**: Simple ADR Format
**Description**: Use standard Architecture Decision Record (ADR) format with minimal metadata

**Pros**:
- Well-known format in software engineering
- Simple to implement and understand
- Established tooling and practices available
- Low learning curve for contributors

**Cons**:
- Limited metadata for complex decision tracking
- No integration with Company OS service architecture
- Insufficient context capture for deterministic rebuilding
- Missing connections to signals, briefs, and learning loops

**Estimated Effort**: Low (1-2 hours)
**Risk Assessment**: Medium risk of insufficient context for future system understanding

### **Option B**: Custom Comprehensive Format
**Description**: Create entirely custom format optimized for Company OS self-evolution needs

**Pros**:
- Perfect fit for Company OS requirements
- Full integration with all system components
- Complete context capture for deterministic rebuilding
- Native support for learning loops and signal generation

**Cons**:
- Higher complexity and learning curve
- More effort to implement and maintain
- Risk of over-engineering for current needs
- No existing community practices to leverage

**Estimated Effort**: High (6-8 hours)
**Risk Assessment**: Low risk for system needs, medium risk of over-complexity

### **Option C**: Hybrid Approach (Selected)
**Description**: ADR-inspired structure enhanced with Company OS-specific metadata and integration

**Pros**:
- Familiar base structure (ADR) with OS-specific enhancements
- Full context capture and deterministic rebuilding support
- Integration with service architecture and learning loops
- Balanced complexity appropriate for Stage 0
- Extensible for future system evolution

**Cons**:
- More complex than simple ADR
- Requires custom template and rules development
- Learning curve for Company OS-specific elements

**Estimated Effort**: Medium (4-5 hours)
**Risk Assessment**: Low risk, good balance of capability and complexity

---

## **Decision**

### **Selected Option**: Hybrid Approach (Option C)

### **Rationale**
The hybrid approach provides the optimal balance between familiar structure and Company OS-specific requirements. It leverages the proven ADR format while adding essential metadata and integration points needed for:

1. **Deterministic System Understanding**: Complete context capture enables future reconstruction of decision paths
2. **Self-Evolution Support**: Integration with signals, briefs, and learning loops enables the system to learn from decision outcomes
3. **Service Architecture Alignment**: Proper placement in work boundary and integration with other services
4. **Extensibility**: Structure can evolve as the system advances through stages without breaking existing records

The decision aligns with Knowledge Architecture Charter principles of atomic documents, explicit metadata, and evolution on demand.

### **Charter Alignment**
This decision directly implements the Knowledge Architecture Charter's vision of "a self-organizing, living knowledge graph" by creating special knowledge nodes (decision records) that "preserve the 'why' behind every choice and enable future reconstruction of decision paths."

## **Consequences**

### **Immediate Impact**
- All future significant decisions must follow the established decision record format
- Decision-making process becomes more systematic and documented
- New rules and templates are available for immediate use
- First decision record serves as working example

### **Long-term Effects**
- **Enables**:
  - Deterministic system understanding and reconstruction
  - Learning from decision outcomes through signal generation
  - Future AI agents to understand historical decision context
  - System evolution based on decision effectiveness patterns
- **Prevents**:
  - Tribal knowledge accumulation
  - Lost context for why decisions were made
  - Repeated discussions on already-decided issues
- **Creates**:
  - New responsibility for systematic decision documentation
  - Integration touchpoints with signals, briefs, and projects
  - Foundation for future decision support tooling

### **Success Metrics**
- **Decision Coverage**: >90% of significant decisions documented within 1 week of being made
- **Context Completeness**: Decision records contain sufficient information for independent understanding
- **Signal Generation**: Decision outcomes generate learning signals within 30 days
- **System Understanding**: New team members can understand decision history without tribal knowledge

### **Risk Mitigation**
- **Risk**: Process overhead reduces decision velocity â†’ **Mitigation**: Template and rules streamline creation; focus on significant decisions only
- **Risk**: Inconsistent adoption across team â†’ **Mitigation**: Clear rules, examples, and integration with existing workflows
- **Risk**: Format becomes outdated as system evolves â†’ **Mitigation**: Meta-decision rules enable format evolution; template versioning

  - Number of decision records created
  - Time taken to create each record
  - Reference frequency of existing records
  - Quality of context capture (subjective assessment)
- **Frequency**: Monthly review of metrics
- **Responsibility**: OS Core Team during system evolution cycles

### **Signal Generation**

## **Notes**

This decision record serves as both the documentation of the decision to create decision records AND as the first working example of the format in action. It demonstrates all required sections and shows how to capture the complete context of a meta-decision about the system itself.

The timestamp verification requirement added to Knowledge System Rules ensures all future decision records will have accurate creation dates, supporting the deterministic rebuilding goal.

Future decision records should reference this one as an example of format and completeness.
