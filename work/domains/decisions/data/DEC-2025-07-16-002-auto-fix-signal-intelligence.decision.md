## **Context**

### **Problem Statement**
Auto-fix patterns in documentation workflows contain valuable intelligence about systemic quality issues, developer training needs, and process improvement opportunities. Without structured signal generation and analysis, these patterns remain hidden and actionable insights are lost.

### **Triggering Signals**
- **Post-commit Auto-fix Implementation**: DEC-2025-07-16-001 enables auto-fix pattern capture
- **Signal Intelligence Framework**: Existing signal intelligence system ready for auto-fix integration
- **Quality Improvement Opportunity**: Auto-fix data can drive proactive quality management
- **Pattern Detection Need**: Recurring auto-fixes indicate systemic issues requiring intervention

### **Constraints**
- **Signal Quality**: Must generate actionable, not noisy signals
- **Performance**: Signal processing must not impact developer workflow
- **Privacy**: Must respect developer privacy while capturing patterns
- **Integration**: Must align with existing signal intelligence architecture
- **Scalability**: Must work across multiple repositories and teams

### **Assumptions**
- Auto-fix patterns correlate with systemic documentation quality issues
- Signal intelligence can drive measurable improvements in quality processes
- Developers will respond positively to actionable quality insights
- Pattern thresholds can be tuned based on empirical data

### **Environment State**
- **Signal Intelligence System**: Active framework for signal generation and analysis
- **Post-commit Auto-fix**: System capturing auto-fix events (DEC-2025-07-16-001)
- **Documentation Workflow**: Active rules-based validation with auto-fixes
- **Quality Metrics**: Baseline quality measurements for improvement tracking
