# **Decision: LLM Context Document Maintenance Process**

**Decision ID**: DEC-2025-07-14-002  
**Type**: Architectural  
**Status**: Active  
**Urgency**: High  
**Date**: 2025-07-14

---

## **Summary**

This decision establishes how the LLM-CONTEXT.md file will be maintained and kept synchronized with system changes to prevent drift and ensure AI agents always have accurate context when working with the Company OS.

### **Decision**
We will treat LLM-CONTEXT.md as a special knowledge node that requires explicit maintenance rules and validation processes to ensure it remains an accurate representation of the system state.

### **Outcome**
A maintenance process that ensures the LLM context document remains synchronized with system evolution while minimizing maintenance burden.

---

## **Context**

### **Background**
The LLM-CONTEXT.md file was created to provide comprehensive context for AI agents (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.) that don't have direct repository access. This file contains:
- Core vision and philosophy
- First principles and mental models
- System architecture overview
- Current state and challenges
- Practical guidance

### **Problem Statement**
Without explicit maintenance rules, the LLM context document risks becoming outdated as the system evolves, leading to:
- AI agents working with incorrect assumptions
- Inconsistent advice across different AI platforms
- Wasted time correcting misunderstandings
- Potential for introducing errors based on outdated context

### **Constraints**
- The file must remain comprehensive yet concise
- Updates must be traceable and version-controlled
- Maintenance burden must be sustainable
- Changes must be validated for accuracy

---

## **Decision Drivers**

### **Key Factors**
1. **Accuracy Requirements**: AI agents need current, accurate context
2. **Maintenance Burden**: Process must be sustainable long-term
3. **Change Frequency**: System evolves continuously
4. **Impact Scope**: Affects all external AI collaboration

### **Stakeholder Needs**
- **Human Developers**: Need reliable AI assistance
- **AI Agents**: Need accurate system understanding
- **OS Core Team**: Need sustainable maintenance process

---

## **Options Considered**

### **Option 1: Manual Periodic Review**
**Description**: Schedule regular reviews (e.g., weekly) to update the context document.
- **Pros**: Simple process, predictable schedule
- **Cons**: May miss critical changes, time-based not need-based
- **Decision**: Not selected - violates principle of event-driven updates

### **Option 2: Automated Generation**
**Description**: Generate LLM-CONTEXT.md automatically from source documents.
- **Pros**: Always synchronized, no manual work
- **Cons**: Complex to implement, may lose curated quality
- **Decision**: Not selected - premature automation

### **Option 3: Change-Triggered Updates (Selected)**
**Description**: Define specific changes that trigger LLM context updates.
- **Pros**: Updates when needed, maintains quality, traceable
- **Cons**: Requires discipline and clear triggers
- **Decision**: Selected - aligns with event-driven principles

---

## **Decision Details**

### **Implementation Approach**

1. **Define Update Triggers**:
   - Charter modifications (vision, principles, philosophy)
   - New rule sets or major rule updates
   - Architecture changes (new services, boundaries)
   - Critical signals affecting system understanding
   - New mental models or patterns

2. **Maintenance Process**:
   - Changes to trigger documents generate a maintenance signal
   - Signal includes what changed and why it matters
   - LLM context update becomes a brief if significant
   - Updates include version increment and changelog

3. **Validation Requirements**:
   - Test with fresh AI session before committing
   - Verify all cross-references remain valid
   - Ensure examples reflect current patterns
   - Confirm file remains under reasonable size

### **Success Criteria**
- Zero instances of AI agents using outdated context
- Update latency < 24 hours for critical changes
- Maintenance time < 30 minutes per update
- File size remains < 15KB for easy copying

---

## **Consequences**

### **Benefits**
- AI agents always have accurate context
- Reduced friction from context corrections
- Better quality AI assistance
- Clear maintenance accountability

### **Risks & Mitigations**
- **Risk**: Updates forgotten during busy periods
- **Mitigation**: Automated checks for trigger documents

- **Risk**: File becomes too large over time
- **Mitigation**: Regular pruning of less critical content

### **Trade-offs**
- Requires discipline to maintain update triggers
- Adds overhead to certain system changes
- Must balance comprehensiveness with conciseness

---

## **Implementation Plan**

### **Immediate Actions**
1. Add LLM context maintenance rules to Knowledge System Rules
2. Update Repository System Rules to include LLM-CONTEXT.md as special file
3. Create maintenance checklist for trigger events
4. Document first update based on this decision

### **Validation Steps**
1. Test current LLM-CONTEXT.md with fresh AI session
2. Verify all information remains accurate
3. Update any outdated sections found
4. Commit with clear change documentation

---

## **Review & Learning**

### **Review Schedule**
- 30-day review: Assess if triggers are comprehensive
- 90-day review: Evaluate maintenance burden
- Continuous: Capture signals about process effectiveness

### **Success Metrics**
- Number of outdated context incidents
- Average update latency
- Maintenance time per update
- File size growth rate

### **Learning Capture**
This decision itself demonstrates the need for explicit maintenance processes for critical system documents. Future decisions should consider maintenance implications upfront.
