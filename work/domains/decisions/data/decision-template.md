**Instructions for Using This Template:**

1. **Before creating**: Run `date` command to verify current timestamp
2. **Decision ID**: Use format DEC-YYYY-MM-DD-NNN (sequential for the day)
3. **Complete all sections**: Even if some seem not applicable, explain why
4. **Link extensively**: Reference all related signals, briefs, projects, charters
5. **Be specific**: Avoid vague language; provide concrete details
6. **Think deterministically**: Someone should be able to reconstruct this decision from the record
7. **Follow rules**: Adhere to all rules in `decision-system.rules.md`
