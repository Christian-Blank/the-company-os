# Milestone 6: Pre-commit Integration - Verification Report

## Executive Summary

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED**
**Verification Date**: July 16, 2025 at 2:46 PM PDT
**Total Test Cases**: 95+ tests across 10 test suites (including new pre-commit tests)
**Pass Rate**: 100% (All tests passing)

Milestone 6 has been successfully completed with all deliverables implemented, tested, and verified. The pre-commit integration is fully functional with comprehensive testing coverage and proper build system integration.

## Deliverables Verification

### ✅ Primary Deliverables
- **Pre-commit hook scripts**: Two hooks implemented (`rules-sync` and `rules-validate`)
- **Hook installation/removal commands**: Integrated with standard pre-commit framework
- **Selective validation**: Only processes markdown files for optimal performance
- **Performance optimization**: Hooks complete in <2s for typical changes

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria Met
- Pre-commit hooks install correctly via `pre-commit install`
- Hooks validate only markdown files staged for commit
- Performance requirement met (<2s for typical changes)
- Clear, actionable feedback provided on validation failures
- Automatic rules synchronization before validation

## Implementation Tasks Verification

### ✅ Task 6.1: Create pre-commit hook configuration
- [x] `.pre-commit-hooks.yaml` file created with proper hook definitions
- [x] `rules-sync` hook defined to run automatically on every commit
- [x] `rules-validate` hook defined to run only on markdown files

### ✅ Task 6.2: Implement hook logic
- [x] Hooks intelligently receive file lists from pre-commit framework
- [x] File filtering implemented (markdown files only for validation)
- [x] Rules sync runs efficiently on every commit
- [x] Auto-fix enabled by default with clear notifications

### ✅ Task 6.3: Add hook to project configuration
- [x] Main `.pre-commit-config.yaml` created for repository
- [x] File patterns configured (`types: [markdown]`)
- [x] Proper hook ordering and dependencies

### ✅ Task 6.4: Optimize for performance
- [x] CLI commands start up quickly through direct imports
- [x] Validation runs only on necessary subset of files
- [x] Performance benchmarks met (<2s execution time)

### ✅ Task 6.5: Create test suite
- [x] Comprehensive unit tests for hook functionality
- [x] Performance tests verify <2s execution time
- [x] Integration tests with Bazel build system
- [x] Edge case testing for various scenarios

### ✅ Task 6.6: Add documentation
- [x] Pre-commit setup instructions added to project documentation
- [x] Hook behavior documented (auto-fix enabled by default)
- [x] Troubleshooting guidance provided

## Architecture Decisions

### ✅ Implementation Approach
- **Separate entry points**: Created `sync_hook.py` and `validate_hook.py` for cleaner separation
- **Bazel integration**: Hooks use Bazel build system for consistency
- **Direct CLI imports**: Performance-optimized with direct module imports
- **Rich output**: Colored, user-friendly feedback with progress indicators

- Bazel build system fully functional
- No dependency conflicts or missing modules

### ✅ Build Success
```bash
bazel build //company_os/domains/rules_service/...
```

- No build errors or warnings
- Hook binaries build and run correctly

## Pre-commit Integration Verification

### ✅ Hook Configuration
```yaml
-   repo: local
    hooks:
    -   id: rules-sync
        name: Rules Service - Sync
        entry: bazel run //company_os/domains/rules_service/adapters/pre_commit:rules_sync_hook --
        language: system
        pass_filenames: false
        always_run: true
        stages: [commit]
    -   id: rules-validate
        name: Rules Service - Validate
        entry: bazel run //company_os/domains/rules_service/adapters/pre_commit:rules_validate_hook --
        language: system
        types: [markdown]
        stages: [commit]
```

### ✅ Key Features Working
