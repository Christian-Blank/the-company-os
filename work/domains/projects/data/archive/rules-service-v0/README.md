# **Project: Rules Service v0 Implementation**

**A comprehensive implementation project for the Rules Service Stage 0 following the Synapse methodology with atomic, stateful development milestones.**

---

## **Project Overview**

### **Mission Statement**
Implement Rules Service v0 as a Stage 0 (file-based) service that provides rule discovery, synchronization, and validation capabilities, laying the foundation for future evolution to API-based services.

### **Strategic Context**
This project addresses **SIG-2025-07-14-001** (System complexity exceeding manual capacity) by automating rule management and validation, enabling the Company OS to scale beyond manual maintenance limits.

### **Key Deliverables**
1. **Rules Discovery Engine**: Scan and parse `.rules.md` files across the repository
2. **Synchronization System**: Keep coding agent rule folders in sync with canonical sources
3. **Validation Service**: Validate markdown documents against extracted rules
4. **CLI Interface**: User-friendly command-line tools for rule management
5. **Pre-commit Integration**: Automated validation and sync on git operations

## **Technical Architecture**

### **Hexagonal Architecture Pattern**
Following [DEC-2025-07-15-001](../../decisions/data/DEC-2025-07-15-001-core-adapter-architecture.decision.md) and [Service System Rules](../../../../os/domains/rules/data/service-system.rules.md):

```

### **Service Boundaries**
Per Service System Rule 1.4, the Rules Service owns:
- **Rule Discovery**: Finding and parsing `.rules.md` files
- **Rule Distribution**: Syncing rules to agent-specific folders
- **Document Validation**: Validating markdown documents against rules
- **Validation Rule Extraction**: Deriving validation logic from rule templates

The Rules Service does NOT own:
- **Rule Creation**: Rules are authored manually following templates
- **Rule Content**: The semantic meaning and business logic of rules
- **Document Storage**: Documents remain in their service domains
- **Fix Application**: Only suggests fixes, actual application is user-controlled

### **Technology Stack**
- **Language**: Python 3.13 with full type hints
- **Data Models**: Pydantic v2 for validation and serialization
- **Build System**: Bazel for reproducible builds
- **CLI Framework**: Typer for command-line interface
- **Markdown Processing**: mistune for parsing
- **YAML Processing**: ruamel.yaml for frontmatter

---

## **Implementation Plan**

### **Development Methodology**
Following the **Synapse Methodology** for atomic, stateful development:

- **Atomic Milestones**: Each milestone is independently testable and deployable
- **Stateful Progress**: Can start, stop, and resume at any milestone boundary
- **Parallel Execution**: Multiple developers/agents can work on different milestones
- **Context Preservation**: Each milestone includes complete context and acceptance criteria

### **Success Criteria**
- **Metric 1**: `rules init` completes <30s on repo clone (100% target)
- **Metric 2**: Pre-commit sync latency <2s
- **Metric 3**: Post-deployment drift incidents = 0 in first 30 days
- **Metric 4**: >90% markdown documents pass validation
- **Metric 5**: >80% formatting issues auto-fixed

---

## **Success Metrics & Monitoring**

### **Implementation Metrics**
- **Velocity**: Points completed per day
- **Quality**: Test coverage and defect rate
- **Blockers**: Time spent on external dependencies

### **Operational Metrics**
- **Performance**: Command execution times
- **Reliability**: Success rate of operations
- **Usability**: User feedback and error rates

---

## **Risk Management**

### **Technical Risks**
- **Dependency Conflicts**: Mitigated by Bazel isolated builds
- **Performance Issues**: Addressed through incremental optimization
- **Integration Complexity**: Managed through hexagonal architecture

### **Process Risks**
- **Scope Creep**: Controlled through strict milestone acceptance criteria
- **Context Loss**: Prevented by comprehensive documentation
- **Parallel Conflicts**: Avoided through clear interface definitions

---

## **Future Evolution Path**

### **Stage 0 → 1 Triggers**
- **API Demand**: When 3+ services need programmatic access
- **Performance**: When file operations exceed 1s average
- **Scale**: When repository exceeds 1000 rule files

### **Stage 1 Evolution**
- **Rules API**: RESTful API for rule management
- **Validation Service**: Standalone validation microservice
- **Real-time Sync**: WebSocket-based rule synchronization

---

## **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**
- Python 3.13+ with type checking enabled
- Bazel for build management
- Git for version control
- Access to Company OS repository

### **Quick Start**
1. **Clone Repository**: `git clone [repository-url]`
2. **Navigate to Project**: `cd work/domains/projects/data/rules-service-v0`
3. **Review Context**: Read this README and all referenced documents
4. **Start Development**: Begin with Milestone 1 implementation

### **Development Commands**
```bash
# Build all packages
bazel build //...

# Run tests
bazel test //...

# Install CLI locally
pip install -e .

# Run validation
rules validate path/to/document.md
```

### **Pre-commit Setup**
```bash
# Install pre-commit
pip install pre-commit

# Install the git hooks
pre-commit install

# Test hooks manually
pre-commit run --all-files

# Run specific hook
pre-commit run rules-validate --all-files
pre-commit run rules-sync

# Uninstall hooks (if needed)
pre-commit uninstall
```

**Hook Behavior**:
- **rules-sync**: Runs on every commit to ensure agent folders are synchronized
- **rules-validate**: Runs only on markdown files with auto-fix enabled by default
- Both hooks provide rich, colored output with clear success/failure indicators
- Validation failures will block the commit with actionable feedback
