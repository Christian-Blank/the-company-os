# **Rules Service v0 Sanity Check Results**

## **Executive Summary**

The Rules Service v0 implementation plan has been reviewed against Company OS principles, charters, and rules. Several critical adjustments were made to ensure proper adherence to our patterns. The plan is now compliant and ready for implementation.

## **Critical Issues Addressed**

### 1. **Service Directory Structure Compliance**

**Issue**: Original structure violated Service System Rule 1.2 by placing adapters at the root level.

**Resolution**: Restructured to follow the standard service domain pattern:
```
/os/domains/rules_service/         # Service domain root
├── data/                          # Stage 0 storage
├── api/                           # Interface definitions
├── adapters/                      # Within service boundary
│   ├── cli/
│   └── pre_commit/
├── schemas/                       # Domain schemas
├── docs/                          # Service documentation
│   ├── boundaries.md             # Required by Rule 1.4
│   └── evolution-log.md          # Required by Rule 2.3
└── src/                          # Implementation code
```

### 2. **Service Registration Requirement**

**Issue**: Missing requirement to register service in `/os/domains/registry/data/services.registry.md` (Rule 5.1).

**Resolution**: Added to Milestone 1 Task 1.2 with specific deliverables:
- Add Rules Service entry with Stage 0 status
- Document service capabilities and interfaces
- Include evolution triggers

### 3. **Service Boundary Documentation**

**Issue**: Unclear boundaries between Rules Service and validation functionality.

**Resolution**: Added explicit boundary documentation requirements:
- Created requirement for `/docs/boundaries.md` in Milestone 1
- Clearly defined what the service owns vs. doesn't own
- Documented validation as capability within Rules Service

### 4. **Evolution Documentation**

**Issue**: Missing requirement for evolution log per Rule 2.3.

**Resolution**: Added `/docs/evolution-log.md` initialization to Milestone 1 for tracking:
- Current stage
- Reason for evolution
- Migration plan
- Rollback strategy

## **Key Architectural Decisions Validated**

### ✅ **Hexagonal Architecture**
- Properly separates domain logic, ports, and adapters
- Enables clean testing and future evolution
- Follows Company OS patterns correctly

### ✅ **Stage 0 Implementation**
- Correctly starts with file-based approach
- Avoids premature optimization
- Aligns with "Evolution on Demand" principle

### ✅ **Synapse Methodology**
- Excellent use of atomic, stateful milestones
- Clear acceptance criteria for each milestone
- Supports parallel development where appropriate

### ✅ **Tech Stack Compliance**
- Python 3.13, Pydantic v2, Bazel choices align with tech-stack.rules.md
- Proper dependency management approach

## **Recommendations for Implementation**

### 1. **Start with Service Setup**
Ensure Milestone 1 properly establishes the service structure before any implementation:
- Create all required directories
- Register service immediately
- Document boundaries clearly

### 2. **Maintain Service Isolation**
Remember Rule 3.1: No direct data access between services
- Use defined interfaces only
- Plan for future API exposure even in Stage 0

### 3. **Track Evolution Signals**
As you implement, capture signals about:
- Performance bottlenecks
- Integration friction
- Missing capabilities
- These will drive Stage 0 → 1 evolution

### 4. **Document Integration Points**
Even in Stage 0, document how other services will interact:
- How will other services query rules?
- How will validation results be consumed?
- What events might the service emit?

## **Overall Assessment**

**Status**: ✅ **APPROVED WITH CORRECTIONS**

The Rules Service v0 implementation plan is now fully compliant with Company OS patterns and principles. The corrections ensure:

1. **Proper service boundaries** are maintained
2. **Evolution path** is clear and documented
3. **Integration patterns** follow Company OS standards
4. **Documentation requirements** are complete

The plan demonstrates excellent understanding of:
- Synapse methodology for atomic development
- Hexagonal architecture for clean separation
- Stage-based evolution approach
- Signal-driven improvement cycles

## **Next Steps**

1. **Begin Milestone 1** with focus on proper service setup
2. **Create service directory structure** as specified
3. **Register service** in the service registry
4. **Document boundaries** clearly from the start
5. **Track all friction** as signals for future evolution

The implementation can now proceed with confidence that it properly adheres to Company OS patterns and will integrate cleanly with the broader system architecture.

*This review ensures the Rules Service v0 will set a strong precedent for future service implementations in the Company OS ecosystem.*
