# Phase 5: Testing & Validation

Comprehensive testing including unit, integration, and workflow replay tests to ensure system reliability.

## Phase Overview

**Duration:** 1 week
**Start Date:** TBD
**End Date:** TBD
**Status:** Not Started
**Owner:** @christian
**Prerequisites:** Phases 1-4 completed

## Objectives

1. Achieve comprehensive test coverage (>80%)
2. Validate workflow reliability and error handling
3. Test all external integrations
4. Ensure performance meets SLAs

  - [ ] Document test strategy
  - [ ] Create test case catalog
  - [ ] Write debugging guide
  - [ ] Document known issues

## Deliverables

1. **Test Suite** - Comprehensive automated tests
2. **Coverage Report** - >80% code coverage
3. **Performance Report** - SLA compliance verification
4. **Test Documentation** - Strategy and procedures
5. **CI Integration** - Tests run automatically

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All tests pass consistently
- [ ] Code coverage exceeds 80%
- [ ] Workflow executes in <5 minutes
- [ ] No critical bugs found
- [ ] Error scenarios handled properly

## Test Strategy

### Testing Pyramid
```
         /\
        /  \    E2E Tests (5%)
       /----\
      /      \  Integration Tests (25%)
     /--------\
    /          \ Unit Tests (70%)
   /____________\
```

### Mock Strategy
- Mock all external APIs in unit tests
- Use recorded responses for integration tests
- Real APIs only in limited E2E tests

### Coverage Goals
- Workflows: 90%+
- Activities: 85%+
- Adapters: 80%+
- Overall: 80%+

## Next Phase

Upon completion, proceed to [Phase 6: Deployment & Operations](../phase-6-deployment/README.md)
