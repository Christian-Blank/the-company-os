# Phase 6: Deployment & Operations

CI/CD pipeline, monitoring, and production deployment preparation for the Repo Guardian workflow.

## Phase Overview

**Duration:** 1 week
**Start Date:** TBD
**End Date:** TBD
**Status:** Not Started
**Owner:** @christian
**Prerequisites:** Phases 1-5 completed

## Objectives

1. Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment
2. Configure monitoring and observability
3. Prepare production deployment artifacts
4. Create operational documentation

## Task Checklist

### CI/CD Pipeline
- [ ] **GitHub Actions Workflow**
  - [ ] Create `.github/workflows/repo-guardian.yml`
  - [ ] Configure build steps:
    - [ ] Checkout code
    - [ ] Set up Python environment
    - [ ] Install dependencies
    - [ ] Run linting (ruff)
    - [ ] Run type checking (mypy)
    - [ ] Run tests with coverage
  - [ ] Configure deployment steps
  - [ ] Set up secrets management

- [ ] **Build Pipeline**
  - [ ] Bazel build configuration
  - [ ] Docker image creation
  - [ ] Image scanning for vulnerabilities
  - [ ] Artifact registry push
  - [ ] Version tagging strategy

### Container & Deployment
- [ ] **Docker Configuration**
  - [ ] Create `Dockerfile` for worker
  - [ ] Multi-stage build for optimization
  - [ ] Non-root user setup

  - [ ] Distributed trace context
  - [ ] Performance bottleneck identification

### Production Readiness
- [ ] **Security Hardening**
  - [ ] Secret rotation procedures
  - [ ] Network policies
  - [ ] RBAC configuration
  - [ ] Security scanning in CI

- [ ] **Operational Procedures**
  - [ ] Deployment runbook

  - [ ] Troubleshooting steps

- [ ] **API Documentation**
  - [ ] Workflow inputs/outputs
  - [ ] Activity interfaces
  - [ ] Configuration options
  - [ ] Integration points

## Deliverables

1. **CI/CD Pipeline** - Automated build and deploy
2. **Container Images** - Production-ready Docker images
3. **Deployment Configs** - K8s manifests or Helm charts
4. **Monitoring Setup** - Metrics, logs, and dashboards
5. **Documentation** - Complete operational guides

## Success Criteria

- [ ] CI pipeline runs in <10 minutes
- [ ] Zero manual deployment steps
- [ ] All metrics visible in dashboards
- [ ] Deployment rollback tested
- [ ] Documentation peer-reviewed

## Deployment Strategy

### Environments
1. **Development** - Continuous deployment from main
2. **Staging** - Weekly releases for testing
3. **Production** - Bi-weekly releases with approval

### Release Process
```yaml
1. Code merged to main
2. CI builds and tests
3. Docker image pushed
4. Auto-deploy to dev
5. Manual promote to staging
6. Approval for production
7. Monitored rollout
```

### Rollback Plan
- Temporal version compatibility
- Database migration rollback
- Previous image deployment
- Feature flag disable

## Operations Checklist

### Day 1 Operations
- [ ] Deploy to production
- [ ] Verify metrics flow
- [ ] Test alerting
- [ ] Document issues

### Ongoing Operations
- [ ] Weekly performance review
- [ ] Monthly cost analysis
- [ ] Quarterly security audit
- [ ] Continuous optimization
