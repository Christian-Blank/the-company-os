# Phase 1 Foundation - Summary

## Completed Tasks ✅

### 1. Charter Creation
- Created comprehensive Repo Guardian Charter at `company_os/domains/charters/data/repo-guardian.charter.md`
- Defined vision for AI-human workflow orchestration
- Established governance model and success metrics
- Aligned with Company OS principles

### 2. Dependencies Setup
- Added all required dependencies to `requirements.in`:
  - temporalio (Temporal Python SDK)

  - anthropic (Claude API client)
  - prometheus-client (Metrics)
  - structlog (Logging)
  - PyGithub (GitHub integration)
- Generated `requirements_lock.txt` with hashes
- Successfully installed all dependencies

### 3. Project Structure
- Created complete service directory structure:
  ```
  src/company_os/services/repo_guardian/
  ├── workflows/      # Workflow definitions
  ├── activities/     # Activity implementations
  ├── adapters/       # External integrations
  ├── models/         # Domain models
  └── worker_main.py  # Worker entry point
  ```
- Created placeholder implementations for all modules

### 4. Bazel Configuration
- Created BUILD.bazel with proper dependencies
- Successfully built service with Bazel
- Configured py_library and py_binary targets

### 5. Environment Configuration
- Created `.env.example` with all required configuration
- Created `docker-compose.yml` for local Temporal development
- Documented all configuration options

### 6. Documentation
- Created comprehensive service README
- Included architecture overview
- Added setup instructions
- Provided troubleshooting guide

## Remaining Tasks

### Temporal Testing
To complete Phase 1, run in a separate terminal:
```bash
# Start Temporal development server
temporal server start-dev

# The UI will be available at http://localhost:8233
```

### Service Registry
Still need to:
- Add service to `company_os/domains/registry/data/services.registry.md`
- Create initial evolution log
- Document design decisions

## Key Files Created

1. `company_os/domains/charters/data/repo-guardian.charter.md` - Charter document
2. `src/company_os/services/repo_guardian/` - Complete service structure
3. `src/company_os/services/repo_guardian/README.md` - Service documentation
4. `src/company_os/services/repo_guardian/.env.example` - Configuration template
5. `src/company_os/services/repo_guardian/docker-compose.yml` - Local dev setup
6. `src/company_os/services/repo_guardian/BUILD.bazel` - Build configuration

## Next Steps

1. Test Temporal server connectivity
2. Complete service registry documentation
3. Move to Phase 2: Core Workflow Development

*Phase 1 establishes a solid foundation following Company OS principles of explicit memory and process-first development.*
