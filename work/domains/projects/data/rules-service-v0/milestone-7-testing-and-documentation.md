# **Milestone 7: Testing & Documentation (4 points)**

## **Objective**
Ensure the Rules Service is robust, reliable, and maintainable by completing the test suite, finalizing all documentation, and establishing performance benchmarks.

## **Strategic Context**
This final milestone solidifies the quality of the project. Comprehensive testing prevents regressions, clear documentation enables others to use and contribute to the service, and performance benchmarks provide a baseline for future optimizations.

## **Deliverables**
- [ ] Unit tests for all core modules.
- [ ] Integration tests for CLI commands and pre-commit hooks.
- [ ] Final updates to all project documentation, including the main `README.md`.
- [ ] Performance benchmarks for key operations.

## **Acceptance Criteria**
- [ ] >90% test coverage across the entire service.
- [ ] All unit, integration, and end-to-end tests pass consistently.
- [ ] All project documents are reviewed, updated, and marked as complete.
- [ ] Performance benchmarks are established and documented.

## **Implementation Tasks**

### **Task 7.1: Write comprehensive unit tests**
- [ ] Review all services (`Discovery`, `Sync`, `Validation`) and ensure all public methods have unit tests.
- [ ] Add tests for edge cases, error conditions, and invalid inputs.
- [ ] Use mocking to isolate components during testing.

### **Task 7.2: Create integration test suite**
- [ ] Write tests that cover the full lifecycle: discovery -> sync -> validation.
- [ ] Use the `Typer` test runner to create robust tests for every CLI command and option.
- [ ] Create a fixture-based test suite with a temporary directory structure to test file system interactions.

### **Task 7.3: Update all documentation**
- [ ] Review and update the main project `README.md` with final usage instructions.
- [ ] Review each milestone document and ensure it reflects the final implementation.
- [ ] Add developer documentation, including how to run tests and contribute.

### **Task 7.4: Establish performance benchmarks**
- [ ] Create a script to benchmark key operations (e.g., `rules sync` on a clean repo, `validate` on 100 files).
- [ ] Run the benchmarks and record the results in the project documentation.
- [ ] This provides a baseline to measure against for future performance work.

## **Dependencies**
- **Milestone 6**: Pre-commit Integration (all features are now complete and ready for final testing).

## **Testing Strategy**
- This entire milestone *is* the testing strategy. It focuses on bringing coverage up to the target and solidifying the test suite.

## **Success Metrics**
- Test coverage goal of >90% is achieved.
- All documentation is clear, concise, and accurate.
- The project is left in a clean, well-documented, and maintainable state.

## **Potential Blockers**
- **Flaky Tests**: Intermittent test failures that are hard to diagnose.
- **Coverage Gaps**: Difficulty in testing certain parts of the codebase.

## **Completion Checklist**
- [ ] All implementation tasks completed.
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met.
- [ ] Final test coverage report generated.
- [ ] All project documentation is finalized.
- [ ] Project is ready for release/deployment.

## **Next Steps**
- **Project Completion**: The `rules-service-v0` project is officially complete.
- **Monitoring**: Move into a phase of monitoring the service's performance and gathering user feedback (signals) for v1.
