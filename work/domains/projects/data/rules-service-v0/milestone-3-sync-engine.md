# **Milestone 3: Sync Engine (4 points)**

## **Objective**
Implement an engine to synchronize the canonical rules from the repository to the local, agent-specific folders used by development tools.

## **Strategic Context**
This milestone directly addresses the core requirement of keeping AI agents and developers aligned with the same set of rules. It automates the distribution of rules, reducing configuration drift and ensuring consistent behavior across all tools.

## **Deliverables**
- [ ] Agent folder mapping configuration
- [ ] File synchronization with change detection
- [ ] Conflict resolution strategies
- [ ] Sync status reporting

## **Acceptance Criteria**
- [ ] Syncs rules to `.clinerules/`, `.cursor/rules/`, and other configured agent folders
- [ ] Detects and handles file changes (creations, updates, deletions)
- [ ] Completes sync in <2s for a typical repository
- [ ] Provides clear status feedback to the user (e.g., "3 rules updated, 1 rule added")

## **Implementation Tasks**

### **Task 3.1: Create agent folder mapping configuration**
- [ ] Define a configuration file (e.g., `rules-service.config.yaml`) for specifying agent target directories.
- [ ] Implement a parser for this configuration.
- [ ] Allow for user-specific overrides.

### **Task 3.2: Implement file synchronization with change detection**
- [ ] Create a `SyncService` class.
- [ ] Use file hashes (e.g., SHA256) to detect changes between source and destination files.
- [ ] Implement logic for copying new/updated files and deleting orphaned files.
- [ ] Ensure atomic file operations to prevent partial writes.

### **Task 3.3: Build conflict resolution strategies**
- [ ] Define strategies for handling conflicts (e.g., `overwrite`, `skip`, `ask`).
- [ ] Implement a default strategy (e.g., `overwrite` canonical rules to local folders).
- [ ] Log conflict events for later review.

### **Task 3.4: Add status reporting**
- [ ] Create a `SyncResult` model to capture the outcome of the operation.
- [ ] Track the number of files added, updated, and deleted.
- [ ] Report results clearly to the console.

## **Architecture Decisions**

### **Sync Service Interface**
```python
# /os/domains/rules_service/src/sync.py
from typing import List, Dict
from pathlib import Path
from .models import RuleDocument

class SyncResult:
    added: int = 0
    updated: int = 0
    deleted: int = 0
    skipped: int = 0

class SyncService:
    """Service for synchronizing rule files to agent folders"""

    def __init__(self, config: Dict):
        self.config = config

    def sync_rules(self, rules: List[RuleDocument], dry_run: bool = False) -> SyncResult:
        """Synchronize rules to all configured agent directories."""
        ...
```

### **Configuration Structure**
```yaml
# rules-service.config.yaml
agent_folders:
  - path: ".clinerules/"
    description: "Rules for the Gemini CLI agent."
  - path: ".cursor/rules/"
    description: "Rules for the Cursor IDE."
  - path: ".vscode/rules/"
    description: "Rules for VSCode extensions."
```

## **Dependencies**
- **Milestone 2**: Rules Discovery (requires the list of canonical rules)
- **External**: `pathlib` for file system operations.

## **Testing Strategy**
- **Unit Tests**: Test `SyncService` logic with mock file systems.
- **Integration Tests**: Test synchronization to actual temporary directories.
- **Edge Case Tests**: Test with empty rule sets, read-only destinations, and existing files.

## **Success Metrics**
- Sync operation correctly reflects all changes from the source.
- Performance target of <2s is met.
- User feedback is clear and accurate.

## **Potential Blockers**
- **File System Permissions**: Writing to protected directories.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Differences in file system behavior (Windows vs. Unix).

## **Completion Checklist**
- [ ] All implementation tasks completed.
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met.
- [ ] Unit and integration tests passing.
- [ ] Documentation for the sync service is written.
- [ ] Code committed.

## **Next Steps**
- **Milestone 5**: CLI Interface (the `rules sync` command will use this service).
- **Milestone 6**: Pre-commit Integration (the pre-commit hook will use this service).
