# **Project Vision: Repo Guardian Workflow**

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** July 22, 2025
**Author:** Christian Blank, Agent Cortex
**Status:** Active

---

## **1. Vision (The North Star ⭐)**

To establish a robust foundation for human-AI orchestrated workflows within the Company OS platform, starting with an automated Repo Guardian workflow that leverages Temporal and AI agents to proactively maintain repository quality, manage complexity, and ensure consistent adherence to established patterns and standards.

This system will serve as both a production-ready guardian for the Company OS repository and a reference implementation for future workflow development, demonstrating best practices for AI-human collaboration, workflow orchestration, and continuous system evolution.

---

## **2. The Problem (The Opportunity)**

As the Company OS grows, maintaining consistency and quality becomes increasingly challenging:

* **Manual Complexity Management:** Repository structure and complexity require constant human oversight to prevent drift from established patterns.
* **Inconsistent Quality Enforcement:** Code and document validation happens reactively, often after problems have been introduced.
* **Lost Learning Opportunities:** Valuable insights from daily operations aren't systematically captured for system evolution.
* **Scalability Constraints:** Manual review processes don't scale with repository growth and increased contribution velocity.
* **AI Integration Gaps:** Lack of a proven pattern for integrating LLMs into production workflows with proper orchestration and reliability.

---

## **3. The Solution (The "What")**

We will build a **Temporal-orchestrated Repo Guardian workflow** that combines the reliability of workflow orchestration with the intelligence of AI agents. This system will:

### **3.1 Core Capabilities**
- **Automated Repository Analysis:** Continuously monitor repository changes through diff-based incremental analysis
- **AI-Powered Validation:** Use LLMs to verify code patterns, architectural compliance, and documentation quality
- **Intelligent Issue Generation:** Automatically create structured, actionable GitHub issues from detected problems
- **Metrics & Observability:** Emit operational metrics for monitoring system health and effectiveness
- **Self-Evolution:** Capture signals from operations to inform system improvements

### **3.2 Technical Foundation**
- **Temporal Workflows:** Ensure reliability, state management, and fault tolerance
- **Hexagonal Architecture:** Clean separation between domain logic, ports, and adapters
- **Structured LLM Integration:** JSON-enforced outputs for reliable AI responses
- **Sandboxed Operations:** Secure repository operations in isolated environments
- **Cost-Optimized Design:** Diff-based analysis to minimize LLM token usage

---

## **4. Core Principles (The "How")**

This project embodies the Company OS principles while establishing patterns for future workflows:

* **Explicit Workflow Definition:** All workflow logic is explicitly defined in code, version-controlled, and testable
* **AI as First-Class Citizen:** LLMs are integrated as reliable workflow activities with structured inputs/outputs
* **Observability by Design:** Every workflow emits metrics, logs, and traces for full operational visibility
* **Evolution Through Measurement:** Success metrics drive continuous improvement of both the workflow and the patterns it enforces
* **Hexagonal Architecture:** Clean boundaries enable testing, evolution, and technology flexibility
* **Cost-Conscious AI:** Smart context management and incremental analysis to control LLM costs

---

## **5. Success Metrics (The Finish Line 🏁)**

We will measure success across three dimensions:

### **5.1 Technical Metrics**
- **Workflow Reliability:** <1% workflow failure rate
- **Processing Efficiency:** <5 minute average cycle time for repository analysis
- **Cost Efficiency:** Stable monthly AI costs with sub-linear growth relative to repository size
- **Issue Quality:** >90% of generated issues require no manual editing

### **5.2 Quality Metrics**
- **Complexity Reduction:** Measurable decrease in cyclomatic complexity over time
- **Pattern Compliance:** >95% adherence to established architectural patterns
- **Escape Defect Rate:** <5% of issues slip through to production
- **Documentation Coverage:** 100% of new code includes appropriate documentation

### **5.3 Evolution Metrics**
- **Signal Generation Rate:** >10 actionable signals per week from workflow operations
- **Improvement Velocity:** Monthly reduction in detected anti-patterns
- **Knowledge Capture:** 100% of workflow decisions are traceable and learnable

---

## **6. High-Level Architecture**

The system follows a hexagonal architecture with clear boundaries:
