5. **Actionable outcomes**: Define clear, measurable success criteria
6. **Strategic context**: Explain how this serves broader strategic purposes
7. **Follow rules**: Adhere to all rules in `brief-system.rules.md`

**Brief Types:**
- **strategic**: Long-term, high-impact opportunities affecting multiple domains
- **operational**: Process improvements and operational efficiency gains
- **tactical**: Short-term, focused improvements to specific problems
- **technical**: Technology-focused solutions and infrastructure improvements

**Priority Guidelines:**

### ðŸ”¹ Miniâ€‘Technical Brief
Use this variant **only** when **estimated_effort â‰¤â€¯20 points** *and* the work affects **one or two services** without major architectural risk.
It collapses several sections while preserving evidence, charter alignment, and success measures.

Required frontâ€‘matter fields remain the same; the body must include **only**:

1. **Executive Summary** (â‰¤â€¯250â€¯words)
2. **Problem Statement** (current state & pain points)
3. **Proposed Solution** (overview, key components, success criteria)
4. **Charter Alignment**
5. **Estimated Effort & Risks**
6. **Immediate Next Steps**

All other sections become *optional*; include them only if helpful.
