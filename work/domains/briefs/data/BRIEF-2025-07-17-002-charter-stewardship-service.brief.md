# **Brief: Charter Stewardship Service**

## **Executive Summary**

This brief outlines the establishment of charter stewardship as a core function within Company OS, evolving from manual workflow execution to a fully autonomous service. The charter steward will serve as the Directly Responsible Individual (DRI) for maintaining charter quality, coherence, and effectiveness across the entire charter system.

### **Key Opportunity**

With 11+ active charters governing Company OS, we need systematic stewardship to:
- Maintain charter quality and relevance
- Remove redundancy and conflicts
- Ensure navigability for humans and AI agents
- Enable charter system evolution

### **Recommended Approach**

Establish charter stewardship through progressive stages:
1. **Stage 0**: Manual workflow with AI/human execution
2. **Stage 1**: Semi-automated tooling and validation
3. **Stage 2**: Charter service with API
4. **Stage 3**: Fully autonomous charter management

---

## **Context**

### **Current State**

The Company OS charter system has grown organically to include:
- **Root Charter**: company-os.charter.md
- **Architecture Charters**: 4 (service, repository, knowledge, evolution)
- **Service Charters**: 3+ (rules, maintenance, enterprise-grade)
- **Specialized Charters**: 3+ (brand, agent-role, apn)

**Current challenges**:
- No systematic maintenance process
- Potential redundancies across charters
- Inconsistent formatting and structure
- Manual cross-reference management
- No automated validation

### **Strategic Alignment**

This initiative directly supports:
- **First Principle #5**: Self-Evolution via Double Learning Loop
- **Evolution Architecture Charter**: Continuous system improvement
- **Knowledge Architecture Charter**: Explicit, maintainable knowledge

### **Similar Patterns**

The Rules Service v0 demonstrated successful evolution from manual processes to automated service. Charter stewardship will follow a similar path with lessons learned.

---

## **Constraints and Considerations**

### **Technical Constraints**
- Must work with existing markdown-based charter system
- Cannot break existing charter references
- Must maintain git history and versioning
- Should follow established service patterns

### **Resource Constraints**
- Single steward model (no team initially)
- Limited development resources for tooling
- Must balance with other system priorities
- Incremental investment based on value

### **Risk Factors**
- **Change Resistance**: Stakeholders attached to current charters
- **Scope Creep**: Expanding beyond charter governance
- **Over-Automation**: Losing human judgment too early
- **Integration Complexity**: Multiple system touchpoints

---

## **Implementation Plan**

### **Week 1-2: Foundation**
1. Assign charter steward (AI agent with human supervisor)
2. Execute initial charter assessment
3. Create tracking infrastructure
4. Generate first weekly report

### **Week 3-4: Early Improvements**
1. Address P0/P1 issues from assessment
2. Establish stakeholder communication
3. Begin pattern analysis
4. Document early learnings

### **Month 2: Tooling Development**
1. Design validation tool architecture
2. Build basic automation scripts
3. Create dashboard mockups
4. Plan Stage 1 development

### **Month 3-6: Progressive Evolution**
1. Implement Stage 1 deliverables
2. Measure automation effectiveness
3. Design Stage 2 architecture
4. Build stakeholder confidence

---

## **Resource Requirements**

### **Human Resources**
- **Charter Steward**: 1 FTE equivalent (AI agent or human)
- **Supervisor**: 0.2 FTE for oversight
- **Developer**: 0.5 FTE for tooling (Stage 1+)
- **Stakeholders**: 2-4 hours/month for reviews

### **Technical Resources**
- Access to charter repository
- Compute for automation tools
- Dashboard hosting (Stage 1+)
- API infrastructure (Stage 2+)

### **Budget Estimates**
- **Stage 0**: Minimal (workflow execution only)
- **Stage 1**: $10-20k (basic tooling)
- **Stage 2**: $50-100k (service development)
- **Stage 3**: $100k+ (full autonomy)

---

## **Alternative Approaches**

### **Alternative 1: Distributed Ownership**
- Each charter has individual owner
- No central stewardship function
- **Rejected**: Lacks coherence and systematic improvement

### **Alternative 2: Committee-Based Governance**
- Charter review committee
- Consensus-based changes
- **Rejected**: Too slow and bureaucratic

### **Alternative 3: Full Automation First**
- Build comprehensive tooling immediately
- Skip manual workflow stage
- **Rejected**: Too risky without established patterns

---

## **Recommendations**

### **Immediate Actions**

1. **Approve Brief and Assign Steward**
   - Select AI agent or human steward
   - Assign human supervisor
   - Set weekly review schedule

2. **Execute Initial Assessment**
   - Complete charter inventory
   - Document current state
   - Identify quick wins

3. **Establish Tracking**
   - Create stewardship documents
   - Set up reporting cadence
   - Define success metrics

### **Next Steps**

1. Begin Stage 0 workflow execution
2. Generate signals from early findings
3. Design Stage 1 tooling architecture
4. Build stakeholder engagement plan
5. Document patterns and learnings
