# The Company OS

An experimental, self-evolving operating system for organizations, designed to orchestrate work between human and AI collaborators.

## Vision

This project explores a single, powerful idea: What if the systems we use to work were as intelligent and adaptive as the people they serve?

The Company OS is a prototype of such a system. It's a living framework that learns from workflows, identifies friction, and evolves its own processes and tools. The goal is to create a symbiotic environment where both humans and AI agents can operate in a state of "flow," focusing on high-impact, creative work while the OS handles the operational complexity.

This isn't just about automation; it's about creating a system of collective intelligence that gets smarter over time.

## The Manifesto: Our Guiding Principles

The entire philosophy, vision, and set of guiding principles for this project are codified in a single document. To truly understand the "why" behind this work, please read:

### **[The Company OS Charter](company-os.charter.md)**

## How It Works

The OS is being built as a polyglot, microservice-based architecture where:

* **Processes are Code:** All workflows are defined as explicit, version-controlled artifacts.
* **AIs & Humans are Peers:** Roles are assigned based on capability, not on whether the actor is a person or an algorithm.
* **Evolution is Automated:** A continuous feedback loop observes signals, generates insights, and refines the system.

## Current State

This project is in its early stages after having built previous versions I used during my career known as "NexOS", "Workplace Navigator", "Career Companion", "Symbi-OS", and similar. The architecture, services, and principles will evolve in real-time as the system is built.
