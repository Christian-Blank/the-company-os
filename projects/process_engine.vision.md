## **Project Synapse: The AI-Powered Company Operating System Core**

### **1. Vision (The North Star ‚≠ê)**

Our vision is to create a symbiotic human-AI environment that transforms how our company operates. We will build a central "nervous system" that intelligently orchestrates work, automates processes, and codifies knowledge. This system will empower our team to focus exclusively on passionate, high-impact work by making the *process* of work as smart, adaptive, and autonomous as the products we build.

### **2. The Problem (The Opportunity)**

Today, significant time and resources are lost in the gaps between idea and execution. Key processes rely on tribal knowledge, leading to:

* **Inconsistent Specs:** Product and tech specs vary wildly in quality, causing confusion and engineering rework.
* **Process Bottlenecks:** Unclear, manual processes for tasks like feature definition, technical design, and decision-making slow us down.
* **Knowledge Silos:** Critical business logic and decision rules are trapped in documents and individual experts' heads, making them hard to scale or automate.
* **Onboarding Friction:** New team members struggle to learn "how things are done here."

---

### **3. The Solution (The "What")**

We will build an **AI-first process automation engine** powered by a new, unified standard called **Agentic Process Notation (APN)**.

APN is a human-readable, YAML-based standard designed from the ground up for AI and human-in-the-loop collaboration. It learns from the strengths of established enterprise standards (BPMN, DMN, CMMN) but modernizes them into a single, elegant format:

* **Inspired by BPMN:** APN defines structured, version-controlled workflows that are easy to visualize and follow.
* **Inspired by DMN:** APN can define and execute automated, rule-based decisions within any process.
* **Inspired by CMMN:** APN supports flexible, case-based work by allowing for human discretion and event-driven choices.

By defining all company processes‚Äîfrom spec writing to budget approvals‚Äîas APN files, we create a machine-readable, AI-optimizable, and fully transparent operating system.

### **4. Core Principles (The "How")**

This project is a direct implementation of the Company OS Manifesto:

* **Process-First, Tools-Second:** We will define our core workflows as `.apn.yaml` files *before* building any complex tooling. The process is the product.
* **Human-AI Parity:** APN is designed to be as simple for a human to write in a text editor as it is for an LLM to generate, analyze, or modify.
* **Company as Code:** All processes, rules, and logic will be version-controlled in our central repository, eliminating tribal knowledge.
* **Evolve, Don't Redesign:** We will start with a simple process and incrementally enhance it, allowing the system to learn and grow without disruption.

### **5. The Initial Use Case (The First Step üëü)**

Our first objective is to solve our most immediate pain point: the specification pipeline. We will create two linked APN files:

1.  **`product-spec-creation.apn.yaml`**: A process that guides a Product Manager to define the "what" and "why" of a feature, resulting in a `PRODUCT_APPROVED` artifact.
2.  **`eng-spec-creation.apn.yaml`**: A process that takes the approved product spec as input and guides an Engineer to define the "how," resulting in an `ENG_APPROVED` artifact ready for development.

This creates a seamless, transparent, and high-quality flow from idea to actionable engineering plan.

### **6. High-Level Architecture (The Blueprint üß†‚ö°)**

The system will consist of two distinct, containerized services:

* **The APN Engine (Python üß†):** This service is the "brain." It parses and executes the `.apn.yaml` files, manages state, validates data against the integrated schema, and interacts with LLMs to power AI-driven steps.
* **The Interaction Layer (TypeScript ‚ö°):** This is the "nervous system." It provides the user interface for the processes, whether through a CLI, a Slack bot, or a future web interface. It is stateless and simply communicates with the APN Engine.

---

### **7. Success Metrics (The Finish Line üèÅ)**

We will measure the success of v1 of this system by:

* **Adoption Rate:** The percentage of new features that are defined using the APN system.
* **Time-to-Spec:** A reduction in the average time it takes to get from an idea to an `ENG_APPROVED` spec.
* **Rework Reduction:** A measurable decrease in engineering tasks or stories that are closed due to "incorrect requirements."
* **Team Satisfaction:** Positive qualitative feedback from Product Managers and Engineers on the clarity and efficiency of the new process.
